    "text": "Cube actions\n\nPosition 1\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the board, this looked to White like a strong double. White has an excellent forward structure, a fat racing lead, and a 4-point prime that can be extended from the back in relative safety, since Black has two checkers on the bar. The only weakness is White’s blot on the ace point, but getting hit is not a big deal, so it can’t be much of a liability.\nMeanwhile, Black has made almost no progress; only the 11-point is made.\nWhite guessed this was a strong double, and a smallish take for Black. It is, however, the other way around: White has only a small double, Black has a huge take:\n\n\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,690 (-0,047)\n       Double/Take:   +0,736\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,264)\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n\n\nLooking at the outcome probabilities, we see that White does have a big gammon threat, but also that Black wins more than a third of the games:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.292\n0.340\n0.024\n0.656\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.265\n0.072\n0.007\n0.344\n\n\nSum\n0.557\n0.412\n0.031\n1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne thing that might be overlooked here, is that White has very few real crushing sequences, because he’s a little short on ammo. Black will almost always make some kind of anchor, and then have some kind of counter play agains White’s three back checkers.\nTo see if this result is match-score related, let’s check the same position for money, and while we’re at it, also check if XG Roller ++ (fast, truncated rollouts), gets it right, compared to a full rollout at strong settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,800 (-0,120)\nDouble/Take:   +0,920\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,080)\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nNo double:     +0,784 (-0,134)\nDouble/Take:   +0,918\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,082)\n\n\n\nFor money, the double is bigger, and the take is smaller, so more in line with White’s first impression. It appears that the 2-point lead for White does make a difference.\nBut why?\nThe next table shows Black’s take points under different assumption: a) No cube and no gammons (like a last-roll position); b) no cube and gammon rates from the table above; and c) taking both cube and gammons into account.\n\n\n\n\n\nCube assumptions\nMoney game take point\n7-away, 5-away take point\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nDead cube, no gammons\n0.250\n0.240\n-0.010\n\n\nDead cube, gammons\n0.384\n0.382\n-0.002\n\n\nBoth cube and gammons\n0.343\n0.304\n-0.039\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe last-roll take point is not too different from money at this score, and it also doesn’t make much difference to factor in gammons. When we consider possible recubes, however, we see that Black’s take point at the score, is somewhat lower than it would be for money.\nThis is because he’ll redouble more aggressively at the score. We can see why, by looking at White’s take points for a potential recube, assuming the same gammon frequencies:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube assumptions\nMoney game take point\n5-away, 7-away recube take point\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nDead cube, no gammons\n0.250\n0.266\n0.016\n\n\nDead cube, gammons\n0.264\n0.333\n0.069\n\n\nBoth cube and gammons\n0.236\n0.312\n0.076\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, it looks like a good part of White’s flawed evaluation of the original position, comes from the fact that Black can take somewhat more aggressively at the score; hence White needs more to have a really strong double.\nThe reason for Black’s lower take point at the score, lies mostly in the potential redouble in positions where gammons are possible: It’s hard for White to accept a 4-cube at 5-away 7-away, where a gammon loss is much more costly than a gammon win.\nStill, the position is also a clear take for money, so there’s some reconsideration for White to do in that department too. What will it take to turn the position into a really tough take for money?\nIf we activate the awkward spare on the ace-point, we suddenly have a big pass. Perhaps not surprising, since we’re turning a big liability into a big asset. But still:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,979 (-0,021)\nDouble/Take:   +1,273 (+0,273)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nEven if we put the spare checker in a less ideal place, we still get a double/pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,929 (-0,071)\nDouble/Take:   +1,045 (+0,045)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nThat spare has to move out of the action, to get to a marginal pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,913 (-0,087)\nDouble/Take:   +1,011 (+0,011)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nFinally, we get to a decent take, noting that Black is no longer far behind in the race:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,874 (-0,072)\nDouble/Take:   +0,947\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,053)\n\n\n\nOne way to see how bad White’s ace-point blot is, is to consider the original position after something like 31: 24/20. Now, most aces, like 21, 31, 41, and 51, are below-average rolls for Black, even though they hit. White is hoping to get hit (except with 41 and 11, trying for a high anchor); that’s how bad the blot is.\nAnother experiment would be to improve White’s opportunity to extend the prime from the back. A one-pip change can be huge: We go from a clear take to a pretty clear pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,856 (-0,144)\nDouble/Take:   +1,059 (+0,059)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nAnother change in the same spirit is to bring in another builder for that important 9-point. It has about the same effect as slotting the 9-point:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,854 (-0,146)\nDouble/Take:   +1,065 (+0,065)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nA final one-pip change that has a rather dramatic effect, is to just semi-active the ace-point checker so it easier becomes part of a prime, and is both easier and more attractive to cover. Again, we go from a clear take to a clear pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,849 (-0,151)\nDouble/Take:   +1,062 (+0,062)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nSumming up:\n\nA two-point lead in a 7-point match matters, especially if you might face a recube when gammons are still possible.\nWhat seems to be a strong positional advantage, might not be so strong if there are also liabilities.\nAn awkward ace-point blot can be a rather big liability\nSmall things matter: One pip can make a it much easier to turn a strong position into a winning position.\n\n\n\nPosition 2\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is another example of blitz that could work as a bluff double: It might look like White has a strong blitz going, but in fact the take is easy, and this is not even a double. In practice, it’s not impossible to get a pass. (In the actual game, Black passed this.)\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,579\nDouble/Take:   +0,534 (-0,045)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,421)\n\n\nAt the match score, the error from passing is gigantic, for money it is smaller but still big:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,664 (-0,078)\nDouble/Take:   +0,742\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,258)\n\n\n\nTo better understand why this score is so different from money, we can compare the take points for money and at the score, using different assumptions:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube assumptions\nMoney game take point\n7-away, 5-away take point\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nDead cube, no gammons\n0.250\n0.240\n-0.010\n\n\nDead cube, gammons\n0.369\n0.368\n-0.001\n\n\nBoth cube and gammons\n0.330\n0.288\n-0.042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs in position 1, it is the powerful recube access that makes Black considerable more inclined to take at the score, compare to money game.\nLet’s keep the money game variant, and play with features of the position.\nThe ace-point slots makes all the difference in the world, because it commits White to a blitz. If we turn the slot into a builder White can both blitz or prime, and two strong game plans are much better than one. As a result Black has a moderate sized pass in the variant below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,865 (-0,135)\nDouble/Take:   +1,067 (+0,067)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nAlso, making it a bit easier for White to jump his back checkers, turns the position into just a borderline take.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,784 (-0,211)\nDouble/Take:   +0,996\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,004)\n\n\n\nIn summary, it is the combination of having to jump a prime, without being on the edge, and being committed to a blitz, and being a little short on ammunition, that makes Whites’s position weaker than it might appear.\n\n\nPosition 3\n\n\n\n\n\nWhite had a good start, and considered doubling, but must be mindful of the score, leading 3-away, 5-away. Is the position strong enough to double?\nNo, doubling would be a big mistake:\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nNo double:     +0,452\nDouble/Take:   +0,160 (-0,292)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,548)\n\n\nTo better understand the position, consider two illustrative variants: Money game (left), and money game with White’s 2-point switched back a pip (right) so it becomes the 3-point:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,619\nDouble/Take:   +0,556 (-0,063)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,381)\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,731 (-0,011)\nDouble/Take:   +0,742\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,258)\n\n\n\nThe original is still a no-double for money, although doubling is a much smaller mistake that at the score. Shifting to a better inner point makes a clear difference; now the decision to double is really close, and White has a small double.\nBringing in more ammunition and making the 11-point is required to turn the position into a solid double/take for money, although it would still be a clear no-double at the score:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,686\nDouble/Take:   +0,581 (-0,105)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,314)\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,838 (-0,082)\nDouble/Take:   +0,920\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,080)\n\n\n\nOnly if we in addition to the modifications above, also switch back to the much stronger 4-point, do we have a double at the score, but only just. For money, the position is now a big pass.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,847 (-0,011)\nDouble/Take:   +0,859\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,141)\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,939 (-0,061)\nDouble/Take:   +1,164 (+0,164)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nLet’s compare take points at the score and for money (using outcome probabilities from the original position) to see why cube action is so different at this score than for money:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube assumptions\nMoney game take point\n5-away, 3-away take point\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nDead cube, no gammons\n0.25\n0.287\n0.037\n\n\nDead cube, gammons\n0.36\n0.350\n-0.010\n\n\nBoth cube and gammons\n0.32\n0.258\n-0.062\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile it would actually be harder for Black to accept a double in a short race (a 4-roll position would be a pass), the ability to redouble makes all the difference.\nThe take points are based on the below outcome probabilities from XG roller++. Note that Black has as much as 38 percent to win this game (in the original position):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n35.42\n22.2\n3.91\n61.53\n\n\nOpponent wins\n29.15\n8.8\n0.52\n38.47\n\n\nSum\n64.57\n31.0\n4.43\n100.00\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn summary, when leading 3-away, 5-away, in a typical middle game position, the leader should have a position that is a clear money pass, to consider doubling. That potential re-cube is just too powerful to let your opponent have.\n\n\nPosition 4\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, White figured that escaping with a 6 or making the 9- or 10-point, could lead to a market loss and doubled. White failed to pay enough attention to the match score, and overestimated the position a bit, the combination of which made the decision to double a 0.308 blunder.\nThe three diagrams below show left to right: a) the position for money: A borderline double at best; b) The modification required to turn it into a solid double and a solid take; c) The closest variant that would make the position only a small take for money\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe market loss that White imagined was something like a 63: 22/13, which would indeed have lost White’s market – if Black was not allowed to roll. But Black gets to roll, and most rolls make some kind of improvement that allows Black to take, so true market losers are rare.\nBut the big part of the mistake was failing to account for the match score. It’s easy to see how the ability to recube to 4 is a powerful thing for Black when trailing 7-away, 3-away. After a redouble/take, Black can win 4 points, with the added possibility of winning a gammon and the match; White can win only 3 points and can’t benefit from gammons.\nLet’s line up Black’s take points in a table and compare to money game:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube assumptions\nMoney game take point\n7-away, 3-away take point\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nDead cube, no gammons\n0.250\n0.251\n0.001\n\n\nDead cube, gammons\n0.288\n0.264\n-0.024\n\n\nBoth cube and gammons\n0.252\n0.187\n-0.065\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike we saw in an earlier problem, Black can take really deep at this score and these gammon frequencies – take point all things considered is about 19%.\nFor money White can justify a cube on a sunny day; at the match score he needs a better position.\nThe variant that makes for a marginal money game take, for example, would still be a sizable no-double at the score:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:   +0,731\nDouble/Take: +0,573 (-0,158)\nDouble/Pass: +1,000 (+0,269)\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition 5\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is much the same theme as the previous position: White overestimated their winning chances and figured that escaping the back checker would be a clear market loss. In fact, this is a big no double:\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,385\nDouble/Take:   +0,114 (-0,271)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,615)\n\n\nThe mistake is magnified by the score, but for money it is still a massive no-double:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,488\nDouble/Take:   +0,343 (-0,145)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,512)\n\n\n\nIt is easy to see the mistake considering that escaping and having Black fan, will not even turn it into a double, much less a drop:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,747\nDouble/Take:   +0,713 (-0,035)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,253)\n\n\n\nIn fact, to make this position a close take/pass decision, White needs pretty massive improvements, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in Rollout\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,913 (-0,076)\nDouble/Take:   +0,989\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,011)\n\n\n\nThe weakness of White’s position comes in large part from the the gap on the 4-point. If we close that (by sliding Black’s anchor forward one pip), the the escape/fan-sequence is now a double/take. (The original position, of course, remains a no-double, even with the gap closed, since escape/fan is still not a market loss).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,877 (-0,043)\nDouble/Take:   +0,920\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,080)\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition 6\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this position White underestimated an attacking position, and failed to take the match score into account, and so took a double that is a big pass:\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,984 (-0,016)\nDouble/Take:   +1,300 (+0,300)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\nThe fact that White can lose a costly gammon and can almost never redouble, is what makes the error really big. Black’s gammon value after double/take is 0.57; White’s gammon value is 0.36. Should White decide to redouble, Black can pass and get to match winning chance of 0.09 or take and redouble if he is doing any better than that. So White can’t get much benefit from the cube either.\nBut the position itself is also quite bad, a clear money pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,914 (-0,086)\nDouble/Take:   +1,089 (+0,089)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nPart of the problem with White’s position is the made ace-point; sliding that point back to the 3-point results in a marginal take/pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,884 (-0,112)\nDouble/Take:   +0,996\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,004)\n\n\n\nOf course, removing the annoying double shot that Black has in the outfield, also improves White’s position a lot. Clear money-take here (although still a pass at the original score):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,810 (-0,069)\nDouble/Take:   +0,879\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,121)\n\n\n\nTo turn the position into a take at 3-away, 7-away, White needs a series of improvements: A big upgrade of the ace-point into the 5-point, removing the 14-point shot, and placing Black’s escaped checker a little further from home:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in Rollout\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,892 (-0,106)\nDouble/Take:   +0,997\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,003)\n\n\n\nBlack is still a lot better off than White since he has nearly escaped both back checkers, and is well ahead in the race. Black wins about 70% of the games, but White can probably just squeeze out a very marginal take at the score.\n\n\nPosition 7\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one, half backgame, half holding game, is a little unusual and can be hard to evaluate. Black is, of course, miles behind in the race and need to hit a shot to win. On the positive side, Black has a great defensive structure to generate hits. But not right away, White has no shot-leaving rolls, although there will be later. Since this is not a deep backgame, the gammon danger isn’t too great.\nIn the actual game, White doubled and Black took. It turns out to be small no-double:\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,706\nDouble/Take:   +0,672 (-0,034)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,294)\n\n\nLet’s first confirm that this is not due to the match score: For money the no-double is actually a little bigger:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,696\nDouble/Take:   +0,635 (-0,061)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,304)\n\n\n\nThe market loss that White is hoping for, is something like 62. Then, on average, the market will be lost, as Black needs to roll small to secure enough timing to gain a take. But this is a very good sequence for White, and the market loss is mostly small:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. XG Roller++ 10/4 6/4     eq:+1,010\nPlayer:   76,61% (G:8,72% B:0,10%)\nOpponent: 23,39% (G:1,60% B:0,05%)\n\n\n\nWhite’s big issue is the 4-point gap. If we shift back the 2-point checkers to the 4-point, it’s a whole other story; White is now borderline too good to double:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +1,001\nDouble/Take:   +1,089 (+0,088)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (-0,001)\n\n\n\nTiming is another big issue; we can give Black back a take, even with the 4-point-modification, if also move White forward, improving Black’s timing:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,946 (-0,031)\nDouble/Take:   +0,977\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,023)\n\n\n\nAnother timing experiment: If we in the original position (money game variant) move Black’s spare back 14 pips, his position gets stronger so it becomes even more of a no-double. Note that Black is now also somewhat blocked and risk crunching, but the timing benefit outweigh this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,592\nDouble/Take:   +0,482 (-0,110)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,408)\n\n\n\nInterestingly, clearing White’s 10-point is not a big issue: If we clear the point in a very smooth way with lot’s of new spares, White’s position gets worse, not better, because Black’s timing also improves in the process, and because White now has shot-leaving 3’s, 31, 35, 36, and in general awkward 5’s, in particular 54 and 55.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,569\nDouble/Take:   +0,456 (-0,113)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,431)\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition 8\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is from the same match and somewhat related to the previous position, but a more pure holding game. White has a big, but not decicive, 15-pips lead in the race. White’s game is much improved compared to a standard holding game by the made 7-point, but the gap on the 5-point works the opposite direction, and to some extent cancels out that benefit.\nIn the game White doubled, which is a significant mistake:\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,661\nDouble/Take:   +0,560 (-0,101)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,339)\n\n\nAs is often the case, the mistake is due to a combination of mis-evaluating the score, and the position. For money, it is still a no-double, but the mistake is smaller:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,673\nDouble/Take:   +0,616 (-0,057)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,327)\n\nAnalyzed in Rollout\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,694\nDouble/Take:   +0,649 (-0,045)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,306)\n1296 Games, variance reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube: XG Roller\n\n\n\nThe above analysis includes a full rollout to make sure the truncated XG roller++ is not off. The difference is small.\nIt’s not hard to see that White, leading 3-away, 5-away, should be careful about doubling because a potential recube is powerful. On the other hand, the position has few gammons, and Black may have less recube vig than normal, as is often the case in holding games, where you go from no-double to huge pass after hitting a shot. So let’s examine a bit more.\nThe outcome probabilities, based on XG roller++, is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.676\n0.020\n0.000\n0.697\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.286\n0.017\n0.000\n0.303\n\n\nSum\n0.962\n0.037\n0.001\n1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich yield the following take points, for money and at the score, under different assumptions. (Since gammons and backgammons are so few, it matters little if they are taken into account.)\n\n\n\n\n\nCube assumptions\nMoney game take point\n5-away, 3-away take point\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nDead cube, no gammons\n0.250\n0.287\n0.037\n\n\nDead cube, gammons\n0.254\n0.285\n0.031\n\n\nBoth cube and gammons\n0.218\n0.218\n0.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the trailer has a rather high take point, but also a lot of cube levarage, so that the final take point, taking everything into account, is very similar to money game, for this close to gammonless position.\nSo, the reason why doubling is a bigger mistake at the match score compared to money, is not that Black as much easier take. It is because there is more equity at stake, so close to the end of the match.\nBack to the position itself, in the money game variant.\nThe 5-point-gap is enough of an asset for Black, that if we remove it, White now has s small money-double, even though the race lead is two pips smaller:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,702 (-0,011)\nDouble/Take:   +0,714\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,286)\n\n\n\nThe racing equity is a big part of the story; if we give Black another 9 pip the we go from a huge take to a small pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,951 (-0,049)\nDouble/Take:   +1,047 (+0,047)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\nA combination of the two: Keeping the increased racing deficit but getting back the 5-point-gap, and we’re back to a very small double. It looks like the 5-point gap just about makes it up for trailing an extra 9-pips:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,808 (-0,012)\nDouble/Take:   +0,819\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,181)\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition 9\n\n\n\n\n\nThis position is interesting because both players made a huge error: White by doubling, Black by passing.\nIt’s easy to see that White has a ton of shots (27 rolls hit somewhere), and that Blacks position is badly underdeveloped.\nIt is perhaps less easy to realize that White’s position overall is not all that strong: He is behind in the race, on the bar, and short on attack material. He has 9 bad sixes that doesn’t hit anything, after which Black has at least an even position.\nBottom line is big no double/take:\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nPlayer Winning Chances:   56,23% (G:20,52% B:1,00%)\nOpponent Winning Chances: 43,77% (G:9,54% B:0,42%)\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,375\nDouble/Take:   +0,161 (-0,213)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,625)\n\n\nWhite being on the bar is a really big deal: If we move that checker to the 15-point, White no longer has the 9 bad sixes, and the race is closer. Result is a smallish double, and a clear take for Black:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Analyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,666 (-0,059)\nDouble/Take:   +0,724\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,276)\n\n\n\nIf we move the same checker just another 4 pips forward, White now has a double shot on the vulnerable Black checker on the 8-point and more ammunition closer to the key 4-point. It now becomes a strong double, and a borderline pass:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Analyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,804 (-0,196)\nDouble/Take:   +1,001 (+0,001)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition 10\n\n\n\n\n\nA straight race, a rare 8-cube. If you know that White has about 24% match winning chances if he passes and trails 3-away, 7-away, it is easy to see that this is also the take point at this score and this cube value.\nI you don’t know this by heart, a bit of reasoning will do: Doubling here doesn’t quite double stakes, since after double/take the game will be for 7 points, not 8. True, the 3 additional points are worth a lot, so doubling increases the stake by more than 75%, but still less than the normal 100% increase after double/take in a money game.\nTherefore, the takepoint is a bit smaller that the ordinary 25% dead-cube-no-gammon-takepoint for money.\nChecking the numbers, we see that the difference between winning and losing with the cube at 4 would be \\(0.762 - 0.238 = 0.524\\), and the difference between winning and losing with the cube at 8 would be \\(1-0=1\\). So the stake doesn’t quite double at this score and this cube level, but almost, hence the slightly lower take point.\nIn the position, White trails by two pips, so the take should be clear. The double is also okay, Black is a clear favorite, he is not giving away anything since the cube will be dead, and short races like this are always volatile.\nThe XG-numbers:\n\n\nAnalyzed in Rollout\nNo redouble\n  Player Winning Chances:   68,49% (G:0,00% B:0,00%)\n  Opponent Winning Chances: 31,51% (G:0,00% B:0,00%)\nRedouble/Take\n  Player Winning Chances:   68,42% (G:0,00% B:0,00%)\n  Opponent Winning Chances: 31,58% (G:0,00% B:0,00%)\n\nCubeful Equities:\nNo redouble:     +0,668 (-0,035)\nRedouble/Take:   +0,703\nRedouble/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,297)\n\n\n\n\nPosition 11\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s tempting to take this cube as White. There’s a lot of contact left, and White has a 3-point board, just like Black, as well as racing chances. Still, the take is quite wrong.\nWhite is likely to be hit next turn, and must hope to hit back in order to win. Whites big weakness is the two inner board blots; they make the potential return hits a double edged sword.\nAs we see, the result of having those blots is a devastating number of gammons lost, making the position a clear pass:\n\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller+\nPlayer Winning Chances:   69,58% (G:37,05% B:1,66%)\nOpponent Winning Chances: 30,42% (G:8,14% B:0,37%)\n\nCubeful Equities:\nNo double:     +0,894 (-0,106)\nDouble/Take:   +1,197 (+0,197)\nDouble/Pass:   +1,000\n\n\nNaturally, it is a whole other story if we remove just one of the blots and turn it into a builder.

    "text": "Checker plays\n\nPosition 1\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, White has four reasonable options:\n\n13/11, 13/8, clearing the midpoint\n11/4, placing a spare on the 4-point\n11/6, 11/9, with spares on the 6- and 9-points\n\nUnwilling to break the midpoint as long as reasonable alternatives existed, White played 11/4, wanting to leave fewer shots and cover more outfield, compared to 11/6, 11/9.\nIt is not hard to accept that this can be a mistake:\n11/6, 11/9 also breaks the 11-point, but is more compact. It adds 63 to build the 3-point, slots the 9-point which could be useful, and only leaves 44 as an extra shot (a joker anyway).\n13/11, 13/8, clearing the midpoint, puts full emphasis on White’s all-important 5-point, leaves no shot, and makes it more dangerous for Black to split with a roll like 42.\nThe interesting part is not that XG picks 13/11, 13/8, but the magnitude of the mistake is remarkable; anything but breaking the midpoint is a blunder:\n\n\nXG Roller++ \n1. 13/11 13/8           eq:+0,026\n2. 11/9 11/6            eq:-0,065 (-0,090)\n3. 11/4                 eq:-0,131 (-0,157)\n\n\nThe key is, that after the top play, 9 rolls make a full 5-prime. After the second best play, only 4 rolls do that. Some rolls, 31 and 43, makes the 5-point but breaks the 8, which is not as strong. So the extra builders on the 11- and 8-points have real value.\nNote that White should break the 13-point with a lot of rolls: 54, 43, 62, 42, 32, 51, and the 52 from the actual position.\n51 deserves special mention, the funny looking 13/7 is probably slightly better than the aggressive slot, 11/5, which accomplishes the same thing, but with a different risk/reward ratio: A lot more shots, and a lot more ways to make the 5-point if missed.\nThe shots left in the outfield is not the main concern: 43 should be played 13/10 13/9 with lots of builders at the cost of 5 shots; 43: 11/8, 11/7 would be a blunder even though it looks flexible.\nLikewise, with 32, 13/11, 13/10 is a lot better than 11/9, 11/8, since it creates four active builders for the 5-point rather than just three.\nSumming up, making the 5-point and a 5-point-prime is likely to win the game, and White can easily afford to break the midpoint and leave a few fly-shots to increase the probability of achieving that goal.\nBuilders win out – if they aim at something important, and if they are not too likely to get hit.\n\n\nPositions 2a-2e\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese five positions share a common theme: The right play is hard to find for those of us who learned, back in the day, that the one thing you must never do in backgammon, is to make the ace-point.\n\n\n\nPosition 2a\nXG Roller++ \n1. 5/1* 3/1     eq:+0,266\n2. 8/6 5/1*     eq:+0,215 (-0,051)\n3. 7/1*         eq:+0,204 (-0,062)\n\n\nPosition 2b\nXG Roller++ \n1. 6/1* 2/1     eq:-0,324\n2. 8/7 6/1*     eq:-0,361 (-0,037)\n3. 24/23 6/1*   eq:-0,413 (-0,089)\n\n\n\n\nPosition 2c\nXG Roller++ \n1. 8/6 2/1      eq:+0,178\n2. 8/5          eq:+0,130 (-0,048)\n\n\nPosition 2d\nXG Roller++ \n1. 6/1          eq:+0,767\n2. 8/3*         eq:+0,754 (-0,013)\n3. 9/5 6/5      eq:+0,723 (-0,044)\n\n\n\n\nPosition 2e\nXG Roller++ \n1. 24/23 16/15* 3/2* 2/1    eq:+0,909\n2. 24/23 16/15* 3/2*(2)     eq:+0,857 (-0,052)\n3. 16/15* 8/7 3/2*(2)       eq:+0,850 (-0,059)\n4. 16/15* 8/7 3/2* 2/1      eq:+0,818 (-0,091)\n5. 24/23 16/15* 8/7(2)      eq:+0,804 (-0,105)\n\n\n\nIn position 2a and 2b White must hit, he has the stronger board and while it is not good to get hit back, Black can also do some damage if left alone. After hitting on the ace point, anything but switching point just leave another blot for no particular gain.\nIn 2c White just overlooked switching – an easy thing to do if you learned to play pre-neural nets.\n2d is just a case of a classic blitz: It doesn’t matter too much which points you make; in fact the ace-point may be better to make, since the higher points are easier to cover.\n2e is a little more tricky prime vs. prime kind of thing. The important part is to but three checkers on the bar – then White might have time to recover even if hit back. It’s also good to advance with 24/23. So after three mandatory aces: 24/23, 16/15*, and 3/2*, it is easier to see that 2/1 is the right final ace, since it leaves a direct cover for the slotted 3-point.\nThe positional approach that White tried in the actual game, 24/23 16/15* 8/7(2), is no good; Black can both anchor or hit back.\n\n\nPosition 3\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a technical play, where it is tempting to assume that all reasonable plays are close. Actually, they are not so close.\nObviously the play is all about getting off the gammon. Over the board, White played 19/9, thinking that it hardly mattered, as long as he made crossovers and avoided wastage by playing past the 6-point.\nThe gammon race is close. The probabilities that White will lose a gammon after the five best plays, are listed below.\n\n\n1. 13/7 10/6    53.93% \n2. 19/13 10/6   55.07%\n3. 19/15 13/7   56.63%\n4. 19/9         57.74%\n5. 13/9 13/7    58,07%\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n\n\nThe actual play, 19/9, increases the risk of getting gammoned, by almost 4 percentage points, so for money that would be about a 0.04 mistake, costing 4 percent of the cube value – a significant mistake.\nWhy so much?\nThe main concept in getting-off-the-gammon problems is to avoid “wasting” pips, by playing past the 6-point, those pips don’t help saving the gammon. Playing 10/6 with the 4 does just that, so must be right. Indeed, 10/6 is part of both top plays.\nThis is quite important, especially when the gammon race is close.\nAfter 10/6 with the 4, 13/7 is best with the 6, simply because it creates a smaller stack: Two checkers on the 7- and 13-point, is better than one and four checkers respectively.\n\n\nPosition 4\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is from the same game as position 3, but Black has rolled well, so White is now a big favorite to get gammoned. The 31 White has to play is a little funny, because the correct play seem to violate basic principles for getting off the gammon: Make crossovers; don’t waste pips.\nThe right play is 8/7 8/5, wasting a pip and failing to make two crossovers.\nA little reflection shows that White needs to cater to specific doubles. After any play White needs 7 or 8 crossovers in three rolls, so one of those rolls has to be a double to save the gammon. After 8/7 8/5 any double makes 4 crossover, which is not true for the other plays, so that is the winner.\nIt’s true, that if White makes two crossovers now, with 13/12 8/5, he only needs to generate three crossovers from a future double. But 11 fails to do even that, so it loses a tiny bit there.\nThe other two-crossover play, played in the actual game, is 20/17 13/12 which also fails on 11, and plays worse on 55 and 44 as well.\nThe probabilities of losing a gammon after the 7 best plays are:\n\n\n1. 8/7 8/5      89,63% \n2. 13/12 8/5    89,78% \n3. 20/19 8/5    90,42% \n4. 8/4          90,99% \n5. 20/16        91,03% \n6. 20/19 13/10  91,09% \n7. 20/17 13/12  91,39% \n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n\n\n\n\nPosition 5\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a tough play. White has two reasonable but very different plays: Hitting with 24/18*/14, or priming with 13/7 11/7.\nHitting has big upsides and big downsides. Black hits back on fully 18 rolls, but also has some bad rolls, 4 dancing rolls, and an additional 8 bad sixes. Some hitting rolls, like 51, aren’t too happy either.\nPriming could work, since White is behind in the race. It leaves Black a few immediate horror rolls, 55 and 44, but also some pretty strong hitting aces.\nIn the end, priming comes out slightly better:\n\n\n1. 13/7 11/7          eq:+0,417\n2. 24/18* 18/14       eq:+0,401 (-0,016)\n3. 24/18* 11/7        eq:+0,239 (-0,178)\n\n\nLet’s have a look at the money game variant, together with a very minimal one-pip modification:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++ \n1. 13/7 11/7          eq:+0,413\n2. 24/18* 18/14       eq:+0,405 (-0,008)\n\n\nXG Roller++ \n1. 24/18* 18/14       eq:+0,367\n2. 13/7 11/7          eq:+0,343 (-0,024)\n\n\n\nFor money priming is still right, but now super close; the two plays are basically a photo finish.\nBut why the (small) difference compare to 7-away, 7-away score? The reason is, that the hitting play loses a bit more gammons than the priming play. At the score, the gammon value with the cube at two is 0.54, compare to 0.5 for money, so gammons are slightly more costly. For that reason, the hit is a bit more attractive for money, making the two plays even closer.\nThe real mystery, however, is the variation on the right, where one Black checker from the 5-point has moved back a pip to the 6-point. This seemingly very minor modification makes the hitting play correct by a small but a meaningful amount: 0.024.\nThe reason is, probably, that the change is not so small after all. Note that the equities in the second position are quite a bit lower, so White is significantly worse off. For that reason, there’s a bit less to lose, when the hitting play backfires.\nAlso, and perhaps more importantly, in a priming battle Black can use the extra spare on the 6-point to play future 4s, since that number is blocked on the other side of the board. For example, imagine White makes the priming play in both variations, and Black then rolls 54, making the 2-point. Now, the position with two spares on the 5-point really looks a lot worse than the variant with a spare on each of the 5- and 6-point. (And it is, evaluations confirm.)\nBottom line is that Black is better set-up for priming in the right-hand position, so White should chose another gameplan.\nSmall differences often are not so small.\nLet’s do one more exercise with this position, and look at how a few analogous problems evaluate:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++ \n1. 13/7 8/7           eq:+0,394\n2. 24/23 24/18*       eq:+0,367 (-0,027)\n3. 24/18* 18/17       eq:+0,327 (-0,067)\n4. 24/18* 11/10       eq:+0,314 (-0,080)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++ \n1. 13/7 9/7           eq:+0,411\n2. 24/18* 18/16       eq:+0,302 (-0,109)\n3. 9/3 5/3            eq:+0,290 (-0,121)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++ \n1. 24/21 24/18*       eq:+0,427\n2. 13/7 10/7          eq:+0,413 (-0,015)\n\n\n\nWith a 61 to play, rather that a 64, priming performs better. Not so much because priming is better with 61, but because the alternative hitting plays are all worse than the hit-and-run-almost-home play available with 64.\nIn the second variation, with the same kind of choice for a roll of 62, priming is now a stand-out. Both because hitting and running still doesn’t run as far, and (I think more importantly) because hitting leaves an additional 4 very dangerous returns from the bar: 63 and 54.\nIn the final variation, hitting is slightly right, likely because the 10-point would be valuable to make also, so that checker works also as a slot. (Which may be covered with a 5 from the 15-point.)\n\n\nPosition 6\n\n\n\n\n\nA technical play that White got wrong, by a surprising amount. White wanted to stay back, making it harder for Black to play safe, taking advantage of a stronger home board. The play made was 8/4 5/2, maintaing contact, trying to improve the home board fast.\nThe key is, that White is ahead in the race, not behind, and would like to release the back checker to steer into a more race-like position.\nAny good play involves 22/18 with the 4:\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 22/18 5/2      eq:-0,274\n2. 22/18 8/5      eq:-0,274 (-0,001)\n3. 22/18 6/3      eq:-0,311 (-0,037)\n4. 6/2 5/2        eq:-0,429 (-0,155)\n5. 8/4 5/2        eq:-0,459 (-0,186)\n\n\nAfter 22/18, Black’s best rolls are the ones that hit on his 7-point without leaving returns: 61, 62, 21, 11, 22, 33 equalizing the race, along with 66 and 55, taking the lead in the race.\nBlack’s worst roll, surprisingly, is the quiet 43: 13/10 6/2, the smallest roll that fails to hit, after which the game is more or less equal. Other below-average rolls are the ones that hit but leaves dangerous returns: 52, 51, 42, 41, 32, 64. Black can play safe with these rolls, but is better off taking a moderate risk to get ahead in the race.\nAfter the actual 8/4 5/2, Black’s worst roll is 51, played 8/2, voluntarily leaving only 4 indirect shots. The point is that the supposedly contact-maintaining play generates a lot fewer immediate shots than the contact-breaking play.\n22/18 5/2 is so much better than 8/4 5/2 because it is better both for the race and for the hits.\nIn this variant, where White is behind in the race, 22/18 is still correct, although not by such a big margin, since it doesn’t have the added racing benefits:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 22/18 11/8        eq:-0,598\n2. 22/18 8/5         eq:-0,605 (-0,007)\n3. 22/18 5/2         eq:-0,608 (-0,011)\n4. 11/4              eq:-0,623 (-0,025)\n5. 22/18 6/3         eq:-0,626 (-0,028)\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition 7\n\n\n\n\n\nThis one is a little tricky: On White’s side of the board, White clearly has a priming position, so the indicated game plan would be to extend that prime. 13/7 13/9 is good for that, adding builders for both the 3-point and the 8-point.\nOn the the other side of the board, things are not so clear. Black’s position could be either for blitzing (three disjointed inside points) or for priming. If Black’s position is considered more of a prime, that would be a motivation for White to jump the prime, if considered a blitz, White would be more inclined to keep the anchor.\nOne way to think about it: White’s side of the board calls for a priming play, Black’s side of the board is more ambiguous. So on balance, probably priming is better. Indeed, the nod goes to the priming play, 13/9 13/7, with the top three plays being reasonably close.\n\n\nXG Roller++ \n1. 13/9 13/7        eq:+0,379\n2. 24/20 13/7       eq:+0,365 (-0,013)\n3. 24/14            eq:+0,342 (-0,037)\n4. 24/18 13/9       eq:+0,323 (-0,056)\n5. 24/20 24/18      eq:+0,220 (-0,159)\n\n\nIt’s not too surprising that the 24/20 split is better than the 24/18 split, since the former tries for the better anchor, and gets more return shots if hit.\nAs always, let’s check if the play is affected by some match score related artifact. It is not:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 13/9 13/7        eq:+0,311\n2. 24/20 13/7       eq:+0,299 (-0,012)\n3. 24/14            eq:+0,276 (-0,035)\n4. 24/18 13/9       eq:+0,241 (-0,070)\n5. 24/20 24/18      eq:+0,136 (-0,175)\n\n\n\nLet’s play with the money game variant, and see how the preferred play changes, when we modify the position.\nFirst, if we move one Black checker 13/8, Black has one more checker in the zone. The 8-point is not part of his prime, so overall Black’s position gets more blitz-like. In that light, it is not surprising that the priming plays stands out a little more. The strongest alternative is now running, 24/10, because any split is more dangerous in a blitz-like situation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 13/9 13/7        eq:+0,266\n2. 24/14            eq:+0,232 (-0,034)\n3. 24/20 13/7       eq:+0,215 (-0,052)\n4. 24/18 13/9       eq:+0,181 (-0,086)\n\n\n\nLikewise if we modify Black with 13/6, the position is now even more blitz-like, increasing also the threat on a potential white plot on Black’s ace-point. The priming option is now clearly better.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 13/9 13/7        eq:+0,310\n2. 24/14            eq:+0,233 (-0,077)\n3. 24/20 13/7       eq:+0,223 (-0,087)\n4. 24/18 13/9       eq:+0,169 (-0,140)\n\n\n\nNext, suppose White has a 63 to play instead of 64. Now the strongest split, 24/20, is not available, so again priming stands out more clearly, even though the checker on the 10-point is not a builder for the 3-point. (On the positive side, it doesn’t leave a joker fly-shot either.) Running, 24/15, is now not a contender, because it leaves more shots, and is not as useful as the corresponding 64: 24/14 when missed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 13/10 13/7       eq:+0,304\n2. 13/4             eq:+0,255 (-0,049)\n3. 24/18 13/10      eq:+0,251 (-0,054)\n4. 24/15            eq:+0,223 (-0,082)\n\n\n\nWith 62 White now has the option of splitting with 24/22, which is as good as priming, while the running play is much worse, as expected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 13/11 13/7       eq:+0,315\n2. 24/22 13/7       eq:+0,311 (-0,004)\n3. 13/5             eq:+0,273 (-0,043)\n4. 24/18 13/11      eq:+0,255 (-0,060)\n5. 24/16            eq:+0,188 (-0,127)\n\n\n\nIf White had a 45 to play, priming stands out, since it directly slots the 8-point and the 9-point, threatening to make a full prime next turn. Well worth the price of 6 fly-shots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 13/9 13/8        eq:+0,351\n2. 24/20 13/8       eq:+0,271 (-0,081)\n3. 13/4             eq:+0,255 (-0,096)\n4. 24/15            eq:+0,223 (-0,129)\n\n\n\nIf we make Black’s position less blitz-like, by moving the 6-point spare back to the 8-point, now splitting is correct.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 24/20 13/7       eq:+0,331\n2. 13/9 13/7        eq:+0,302 (-0,029)\n3. 24/14            eq:+0,296 (-0,035)\n4. 24/18 13/9       eq:+0,278 (-0,053)\n5. 24/20 24/18      eq:+0,186 (-0,145)\n\n\n\nAlso, if Black’s back checkers are split, it’s getting harder and more dangerous for White to extend his prime from the rear, so again splitting is slightly best.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 24/20 13/7       eq:+0,173\n2. 13/9 13/7        eq:+0,161 (-0,012)\n3. 24/14            eq:+0,136 (-0,037)\n4. 24/18 13/9       eq:+0,121 (-0,052)\n5. 24/20 24/18      eq:-0,006 (-0,179)\n\n\n\nFinally, if we move Black’s 8-point blot back to his 13-point, splitting is safer, and is now clearly correct. It is now more of a prime vs. prime situation, and the way to play those, is to either extend your own prime or jump the opponent’s prime, depending on the dice roll. Here, White can potentially completely nullify Black’s prime if the attempt for an advanced anchor works. In the light of that opportunity, extending White’s own prime can wait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 24/20 13/7       eq:+0,430\n2. 13/9 13/7        eq:+0,361 (-0,069)\n3. 24/18 13/9       eq:+0,355 (-0,075)\n4. 24/14            eq:+0,334 (-0,096)\n5. 24/20 24/18      eq:+0,312 (-0,118)\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition 8\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a technical play that caused White some trouble. White’s thoughts over the board where something like this: “A hit is fatal, and since outfield control is decent already, there’s no pressing need to leave any indirect shot, so the play is 7/4 7/2. Ugly, but safe.”\nWhat’s missing is the fact that White is behind in the race, not ahead. In fact, the game is just about equal, so it is quite important to hit Black when he is forced off the anchor, and it is important not to leave too many return shots when that happens.\nThe best plays are:\n\n\nXG Roller++\n1. 18/13 6/3        eq:+0,025\n2. 18/15 6/1        eq:+0,011 (-0,013)\n3. 18/15 18/13      eq:-0,001 (-0,026)\n4. 7/4 7/2          eq:-0,072 (-0,097)\n\n\nSo any play that splits off the 18-point is reasonable; the actual play is a blunder.\nAfter 18/13 6/3 White is of course unhappy on the three deadly hits, 53 and 44, but basically on any other roll this play gains over the ‘safe’ play, often a lot. Some rolls like 41, 51, 52, will allow Black to run off the anchor in response to 7/4 7/2, but that would be too dangerous after 18/13 6/3, and he will be forced to crunch his board. These are huge gains for 18/13 6/3.\nRolls where Black must leave the anchor in any case, like 63, 64, 65, is also a big gain for the split.\nAlso rolls that stay put, like 32, 21, 11, works in favor of the split, since White as more flexibility.\nSome things about White’s reasoning was right: Ugliness can be tolerated. After 18/13 there’s no reason to leave an additional three extra flyshots with 18/15 for the 3. 6/3 is uglier but better.\n\n\nPositions 9a-9b\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s a pair of consequtive plays where White got it wrong twice.\nBefore we get to the plays, note that because of the score White can’t yet double, even though both positions would be passes for money. (The first one a small pass, the second a clear pass.) Also, the 22 that Black played in between was also a clear mistake: Since the 11-point doesn’t block anything 9/5(2), making a much needed inner point, would have been better.\nIn the first position, with a 32 to play for White, it may seem reasonable to improve quietly with 13/11 13/10, and watch Black struggle to improve his inflexible position. 7/4 6/4, making the 4-point, is much better.\nIt’s not that 13/11 13/10 is such an awful play, it’s just that making the 4-point is so strong that it is hard to beat.\nIn fact, White kind of just overlooked the best play, since one wouldn’t normally be inclined to give up the very strong barpoint here. White did consider the slotting plays, but 6/4 24/21 leaves Blacks blot on his 2-point alone, and 6/4 13/10 is a little rich.\n7/4 6/4 is not hard to play once you see it. The risk is small to moderate: While 6’s are good for Black, they hardly turn around the game (except the 66 joker). On any other Black roll (like the actual 22 or a nice roll of 31, for example), White is much better of with the made 4-point and the threat of remaking the barpoint for a winning prime.\nBut you can’t make the right play if you don’t consider it.\nThe second position, a roll later, looks similar but really isn’t. This time White slotted with 10/5 6/4, recognizing that that the risk isn’t that great. 10/5 is correct, but the right two is now 24/22.\nThe key is to see that slotting the 4-point is not the same as making it. Black would like to split to the 21-point, and if he can do so while hitting, that’s much stronger. Rolls like 53 or 32 play the same way after the actual slotting play and after the better and quieter 10/5 24/22. 53 goes 24/16 and 32 plays 24/21 8/6 either way – but hitting at the same time if White slots, which is much stronger.\nThe truncated rollouts for the two positions:\n\n\n\nWhite to play 32:\n1. 7/4 6/4       eq:+0,615\n2. 13/11 13/10   eq:+0,510 (-0,105)\n3. 24/21 6/4     eq:+0,507 (-0,108)\n4. 24/21 13/11   eq:+0,496 (-0,119)\n5. 24/22 13/10   eq:+0,477 (-0,138)\n\n\nWhite to play 52:\n1. 24/22 10/5   eq:+0,553\n2. 11/9 10/5    eq:+0,507 (-0,046)\n3. 10/5 6/4     eq:+0,447 (-0,106)\n4. 11/4         eq:+0,437 (-0,116)\n5. 24/22 11/6   eq:+0,419 (-0,133)"

The estimated probabilities are for cubeless money game: What will happen if the game is played to conclusion with no doubling cube at money game conditions.\nTo improve the quality of this estimate, a weighted average of all possible positions after one and after two rolls is calculated; what we call 2- and 3-ply evaluations. The initial neural net evaluation is 1-ply. (In GNU BG, the corresponding plies are called 0, 1, 2, etc.)\nFrom the estimated probability distribution, it is easy to calculate an expected, or average outcome, the equity of the position. This is still assuming money game with no doubling cube. Since that situation never happens under official rules, this number is not terribly relevant. Therefore, XG tries to estimate what the cubeful equity is, using formulas develped by Rick Janowski."

To get the monetary value, they will have to be multiplied by the cube value and the stakes per point.\nThe take point, not taking re-cubes into account, aka the dead-cube take point, is:\n\\[TP= \\frac{L-0.5}{W+L}\\]\nThis is just another way to express the familiar take point formula, most often written like this:\n\\[TP= \\frac{Risk}{Gain + Risk}\\]\nSo, as an example, using the above figures for average wins and losses, our dead-cube take point would be:\n\\[TP = \\frac{1.114 - 0.5}{1.292 + 1.114} = 0.255\\]\nThe dead-cube take point is what we might use in a last roll situation: When the opponent will either win or lose on the next roll, and we will never get the opportunity to redouble.\nThe opposite situation is what we might call the live-cube take point, where we unrealistically assume that our redoubles will always be fully efficient; we will redouble exactly at our opponent’s take point, when he or she will be indifferent between taking and passing.\nThe real take point for most positions is somewhere between these two extremes: Lower that the pessimistic dead-cube take point, but higher that the overly optimistic live-cube take point.\n\nThe continous model\nTo calculate the live-cube take point, we need to briefly visit the so-called continuous model, proposed by Keeler and Spencer, as long back as 1975, in an article called Optimal Doubling in Backgammon.\nThe basic idea is simple: Suppose the winning chance in some game moves smoothly and randomly along. \\(E\\) is the event that the winning probability, \\(x,\\) of player A, rises to \\(x+b\\) before it drops to \\(x-a\\). The probability of \\(E\\) is then:\n\\[P(E) = \\frac{a}{a+b}\\]\nThis applies to any game where winning chance move continuously as time passes. Wheeler and Spencer has a nice example from basketball, paraphrased like this:\nSuppose UCLA has a 90% chance of beating MIT. What is the probability that MIT will have 50% chance of winning at some point during a game? In other words, the probability of MIT winning will have to rise from \\(0.1\\) to \\(0.5\\) before it drops from \\(0.1\\) to \\(0.0\\). So \\(a = 0.1, b = 0.4\\). Then:\n\\[P(E) = \\frac{0.1}{0.1+0.4} = 0.2\\]\nThe probability that MIT will at some point have an even game is: \\(0.2 = 20\\%\\).\nApplying this to backgammon, let’s assume that we accept a cube with winning probability of \\(0.2\\) and that we can double our opponent efficiently out if we reach a winning probability of \\(0.8\\). What are our actual winning chances then, assuming a perfectly continuous game? We need to improve from \\(0.2\\) to \\(0.8\\) before we deteriorate from \\(0.2\\) to \\(0.0\\) so \\(a=0.2, b=0.6\\), and:\n\\[P(E) = \\frac{0.2}{0.2+0.6} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25\\]\nIn other words: The optimistic live-cube model would allow us to take a gammonless game with a cubeless winning probability of just \\(0.2\\) since cube access would turn that into the necessary \\(0.25\\) winning probability. (Keeler and Spencer has a more formal proof of the \\(0.2\\) live-cube take point.)\nAs mentioned, the real-life take point would have to be found somewhere between the live-cube take point of \\(0.2\\) and the dead-cube take point of \\(0.25\\). We can think of it as the weighted average of the two, where the weight represents the cube efficiency or what Janowski calls the cube-life index.\nExperiments show that in long races the take point is about \\(0.215\\), suggesting a cube efficiency of \\(0.7\\) since \\(0.7\\times 0.20 + 0.3\\times 0.25 = 0.215\\)\nIncorporating this into the Janowski formular for take points, we can get an estimated, “real” take point, that takes recubes and cube efficiency into account:\n\\[TP= \\frac{L-0.5}{W+L+0.5x}\\]\nwhere \\(x\\) is what Janowski calls the cube-life index, a number between 0 (where the cube is dead) and 1, where all doubles are efficient, i.e. right at the borderline between a take and a pass.\n\n\nEquity from cube location\nExpanding the above ideas, the Janowski-formulas can be rearranged to express the equity, as a function of game winning chances, \\(p\\), cube efficiency, \\(x\\), and cube location (player, center, opponent):\n\\[E_{player}= p(W+L+0.5x)-L\\] \\[E_{center}= p(W+L+0.5x)-L-0.5x\\] \\[E_{opponent}= \\frac{4}{4-x}(p(W+L+0.5x)-L-0.25x)\\]\nFrom these, we can estimate cube actions and the size of any cube errors.\nA couple of observations:\n\nIt shouldn’t be too difficult to extend this to match play, since \\(W\\) and \\(L\\) can be calculated with match equities, rather than 1, 2, 3 for regular, gammon and backgammon.\nIt is a simplification to assume that gammon frequencies and cube efficiency remain constant through a game; near conclusion games are more likely to be races without gammons and with fewer opportunities to double efficiently. (Of course, any mathematical model is a simplification, in fact, that’s the whole point of such models.)\n\nLet’s do a few practical examples and check if the formulas agree with what XG says.\n\n\nExamples\n\nOpening position\nLet’s look at a position after Black opens with 21, slotting:\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to XG 1-ply, the probabilities of the six possible outcomes of the game, if played to conclusion, are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.3571\n0.1316\n0.0102\n0.4989\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.3654\n0.1285\n0.0072\n0.5011\n\n\nSum\n0.7225\n0.2601\n0.0174\n1.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis comes to a cubeless equity of: \\(E = 0.0069\\); White is a slight underdog to win, but is compensated by a tiny bit of extra gammons and backgammons, so that the game is basically even.\nNote that the numbers that XG reports are probabilities for winning (including gammons and backgammons), gammon (including backgammon), and backgammon. They have to be converted to get probabilities that sum to 1, like in the above table, if one prefers that way of looking at it. (My R-package, backgammon has a function for that.)\nIf we apply Janowski’s take point formulars to the above cubeless probablities, we get:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube\nBlack's take point\nWhite's take point\n\n\n\n\nDead\n0.3107\n0.3032\n\n\nPerfectly live\n0.2604\n0.2541\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll these four numbers align perfectly with what you get when you consult XGs Analyze|Cube Information menu. GNU Backgammon, in Analyze|Market Window, also gives the exact same take points. We can conclude that both programs probably implemented Janowski’s take point formular in the same way for money games.\nOf course, the interesting bit is the actual take points; the “Dead” and “Perfectly live” take point are just lower and upper bounds between which the “real” take point must be found. As mentioned, Janowski just takes a weighted average of the two, to arrive at a guesstimate for the real take point.\nPutting aside for a moment the take points, let’s look at the cubeful equities, i.e. the average or expected value of a position, while taking into account the doubling cube. For White in the above position, using the Janowski formulas, and assuming a cube-life index of \\(0.7\\), we get:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube location\nCalculated Equity\nXG reported Equity\n\n\n\n\nOwned by Player\n0.182\n0.181\n\n\nCentered\n0.008\n0.002\n\n\nOwned by Opponent\n-0.337\n-0.344\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculated equities agrees pretty closely with what XG says.\nNote that XGs reported equity listed as “Owned by Opponent” is doubled, so you can directly compare a non-double action to a double/take action. This is why it looks like Opponent (Black), has about double the equity as Player (White), if owning the cube.\nLet’s examine what GNU says about the same position, to find out if it is applying Janowski like I expect it to. You can’t input specific probabilities, and get the estimated cubeful equities for each cube location, so we’ll need to switch to GNU’s evaluations, which of course are slightly different from XG’s.\nHere, GNU 2-ply (what XG calls 3-ply) cubeless estimates for the same opening position:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.3547\n0.1346\n0.0097\n0.499\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.3582\n0.1353\n0.0075\n0.501\n\n\nSum\n0.7129\n0.2699\n0.0172\n1.000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich comes to a cubeless equity of \\(E = 0.0017\\).\nThe GNU Backgammon Manual, helpfully states that they use a cube-life index, or cube efficiency, of \\(0.68\\) for contact positions. Applying Janowski’s formulars for cubeful equity to the above probabilities and, using \\(0.68\\) as cube efficiency, we get:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube location\nCalculated Equity\nGNU BG reported Equity\n\n\n\n\nOwned by Player\n0.1714\n0.1722\n\n\nCentered\n0.0016\n0.0036\n\n\nOwned by Opponent\n-0.3373\n-0.3373\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Janowski-style calculated equities are all near-identical to what GNU reports. I’m a little unsure if the small discrepancies are due to rounding errors or some other details that I’m not aware of.\nGoing back to the questions of which cube-life index XG uses: Perhaps it depends on the position? (GNU BG uses a slightly lower value, \\(0.60\\) rather than \\(0.68\\), in short races.)\nLets do another example to try to find out.\n\n\nBear-off position\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.49694\n0\n0\n0.49694\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.50306\n0\n0\n0.50306\n\n\nSum\n1.00000\n0\n0\n1.00000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith no gammons, the cubeless take point clearly is \\(0.25\\) and the perfectly efficient cubeful take point is \\(0.20\\) which is also what XG reports.\nThe cubeless equity is also easy to calculate: \\(E=-0.00612\\)\nThe Janowski-style estimated cubeful equities, assuming a cube-life index of \\(0.622,\\) are:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube location\nEstimated Equity\nXG reported Equity\n\n\n\n\nOwned by Player\n0.1484\n0.1484\n\n\nCentered\n-0.0084\n-0.0087\n\n\nOwned by Opponent\n-0.3251\n-0.3252\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe values that XG report are very close to the calculated values, so it must assume a lower cube value in the second position, which would also be reasonable in a medium to short length race like this.\nLet’s do a final example.\n\n\nMiddle game position\n\n\n\n\n\nXG’s 1-ply estimated probabilities are:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.4156\n0.2333\n0.0305\n0.6794\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.2610\n0.0568\n0.0028\n0.3206\n\n\nSum\n0.6766\n0.2901\n0.0333\n1.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cubeless equity is: \\(E=0.5907\\)\nThe Janowski-style estimated cubeful equities, assuming a cube-life index of \\(0.7\\), are:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube location\nEstimated Equity\nXG reported Equity\n\n\n\n\nOwned by Player\n0.8285\n0.8304\n\n\nCentered\n0.7921\n0.8140\n\n\nOwned by Opponent\n0.9570\n0.9557\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nXG’s values are again close to the calculated values, although not exactly the same. The reason for the discrepancy (especially with the cube in the middle) is not obvious. (I used 1-ply to make sure the difference is not due to how the numbers gets aggregated at higher plies.)"

    "text": "Match play\nIn match play, we’re not interested in how much we win or lose in a single game, but in the probability of winning the whole match. For this reason, the appropriate unit is no longer the average value or equity of a position, but our match winning chances, \\(mwc\\).\n\nThe live cube take point\nLet’s see if we can generalize the Janowski formulas to match play. The loss, L, and win, W, part from the money game section above, should be easy enough: We can just plug in match equities from from Kazaross XG2 match equity table, to get the average \\(mwc\\) when losing or winning respectively.\nFrom the continuous model described above, we know that for money:\n\\[TP_{live} = TP_{dead}\\times(1-TP_{live})\\]\nBecause as we now know, \\(TP_{dead}= 0.25\\) and \\(TP_{live} = 0.20\\), so that:\n\\[TP_{live} = 0.25\\times(1-0.20) = 0.20\\]\nThe intuition behind this is, that when we hold he cube, we are “in the game until the end,” that is, until our winning chances are zero, but we don’t have to go to 100% to win; when we have winning chances of \\(0.8\\), we can use the cube to effectively win the game.\nIn match play, our opponent may have a take point different from ours, so we would need to think:\n\\[TP_{live} = TP_{dead}\\times(1-TP_{opponent})\\]\nwhere \\(TP_{live}\\) is our live cube take point, and \\(TP_{opponent}\\) is the opponent’s live cube take point, i.e. assuming all doubles are perfectly efficient. (Again, this is not a very realistic assumption; we use it just to come up with the lowest take point that we can possibly have.)\n\n\nExample: 5-away, 3-away\nLet’s do the simplest possible example of a live cube take point. We’re trailing 5-away, 3-away, (-5,-3 for short), it’s a long race, and we’re being offered an initial double. What are our most optimistic and least optimistic take points?\nOur take point assuming a dead cube is \\(TP_{dead} = 0.287\\) (we skip the actual calculation; it is just the standard one, that I mentioned earlier, \\(TP= \\frac{Risk}{Gain + Risk}\\)).\nIf we ever redouble, then our opponent, if accepting, will have a dead cube, so their live and dead take point is the same, \\(TP_{dead} = TP_{live} = 0.334\\). This is quite high, due to the fact that we can use all four points while our opponent can use only three. That is good news for us, since we don’t have to improve nearly as much as in money game to win with the cube. So in this case, applying the continious model, we get:\n\\[TP_{live}=0.287\\times (1- 0.334) = 0.191\\]\nSo there’s a big difference between the dead-cube and the live-cube take points which make a lot of sense, because owning a cube at 2 when trailing (-5,-3) really is powerful: We only risk one additional point when redoubling, but we can win two extra points. And the opponent will be holding a dead cube, so we’re not giving away anything.\nFor overview, we can put our results in a table like this, adding a column for the “real” take point, which, as mentioned, is just a weighted average of the dead- and the live-cube take point. (Using a weight, or cube efficiency, of \\(0.7\\).)\n\n\n\n\n\nTaker, points away\nDoubler, points away\nCube value\nDead-cube take point\nLive-cube take point\nReal-cube take point\n\n\n\n\n3\n5\n2\n0.33401\n0.33401\n0.33401\n\n\n5\n3\n1\n0.28731\n0.19135\n0.22014\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are all the same numbers that GNU BG and XG reports, in the “Market window” and “Cube Information” dialog boxes. A rollout confirm that in a long race (I tried 125 pips vs 139 pips), trailing (-5,-3), you do indeed have a small take with about 22% winning chances, just like the “real-cube” average indicates.\nThis is about the same as in money game, so the lesson for this score (-5, -3) is that the extraordinary cube leverage just about cancels out the somewhat higher take point (of \\(0.287\\)) one would have without using the cube, so in the end the take point is close to money game. Of course this is for a long race; if it was a very short race or even a last-roll situation we would be back to the higher take point. A four-roll position would be a pass, for example.\n\n\nExample: 25-away, 24-away\nFor fun, let’s study the same example for a much longer match; now we’re being initially doubled when trailing 25-away, 24-away, (-25, -24). Since the recube vig propagates all the way through redouble after redouble, we have to start by considering the last possible double. Counting at fingers, we can discover that the last possible double (after multiple turn-arounds and cube actions), would be when the opponent owns a 16-cube, and we need to decide if we should pass and trail (-25, -8) or accept a 32-cube which will be dead hereafter.\nAll the take points, in tabular form, starting with the 16-cube, where the live-cube take point is identical to the dead-cube take point:\n\n\n\n\n\nTaker, points away\nDoubler, points away\nCube value\nDead-cube take point\nLive-cube take point\nReal-cube take point\n\n\n\n\n25\n24\n16\n0.043\n0.043\n0.043\n\n\n24\n25\n8\n0.233\n0.223\n0.226\n\n\n25\n24\n4\n0.243\n0.189\n0.205\n\n\n24\n25\n2\n0.254\n0.206\n0.221\n\n\n25\n24\n1\n0.253\n0.201\n0.216\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the table we can note that our “real-cube” take point for the initial double is \\(0.216\\), again about the same as for money, which is not surprising in a straight race at the beginning of a long match. We note also our take point, should we ever face a 32-cube, is very low: \\(0.043\\). That’s what we have if we pass and trail (-25, -8), so if we’re doing any better, we should take and play for the match.\nThat means also that the 16-cube is of little value to the opponent, since to use it efficiently, he or she must nearly win first. One way to see that, is to notice that their take point for the 16-cube, is almost the same in the dead-cube model as in the live-cube model. (\\(0.233\\) and \\(0.223\\) respectively.)\nIn a funny way, all the possible future take points affects our take point for the initial double, since the calculations are recursive, with each take point affecting the next.\nTo see this more clearly, we can write out the full calculations. For simplicity, we use \\(TP_1, TP_2, TP_4, TP_8\\), and \\(TP_{16}\\) to indicate the dead-cube take points when the cube is at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. (The column “Dead-cube take point” from the table.) \\(TP_{1_{live}}\\) is the live-cube take point when the cube is at \\(1.\\)\nThen:\n\\[TP_{1_{live}} = TP_1 \\times (1 - TP_2 \\times (1 - TP_4 \\times (1- TP_8 \\times (1-TP_{16}))))\\] Which can be written as:\n\\[\n\\begin{align*}\nTP_{1_{live}} = TP_1 \\\\\n- TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\\\\n+ TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\times TP_4 \\\\\n- TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\times TP_4 \\times TP_8 \\\\\n+ TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\times TP_4 \\times TP_8 \\times TP_{16} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n\\] So it is clear that the big effect on the live-cube take point of course is from the actual dead-cube take point, at the same cube level. Our take point if we eventually gets redoubled from 16 to 32, \\(TP_{16}\\), plays very little role, and is only of theoretical interest. Our opponent’s take point when we redouble, \\(TP_2\\), on the other hand, does play a role, as the (-5,-3) example showed.\nWe can plot the take points to show this effect, starting with the dead-cube take point at cube level 1, then work subsequent take points into the live cube model, one by one:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see how we get from the initial dead-cube take point of 0.253 to the live-cube take point of 0.201. Each subsequent take point has less and less of an impact on our initial take point. And let’s just rember once again that the real take point is to be found between these two values; when the game still has a way to go, it is usually closer to live-cube take point that to the dead-cube take point.\n\n\nExample with gammons\nOkay, so far it seems possible to (more or less) reproduce how XG and GNU BG transforms cubeless distributions into cubeful match equities and takepoints. Let’s try a match play example with lots of gammons, with us playing White and leading (-4,-7).\nA standard opening blitz after 63, 55, dance, looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nGNU BG 2-ply evaluates the position like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.2709\n0.3728\n0.0167\n0.6604\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.2543\n0.0807\n0.0046\n0.3396\n\n\nSum\n0.5252\n0.4535\n0.0213\n1.0000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re clear favorites with a strong gammon threat; it is more likely that we will win a gammon than a single game. If we double, a gammon will win the match exactly, while a single win will put us at 2-away which is also valuable. However, our opponent will be quick to redouble, after which our gammons will be worthless and his gammons will be lethal.\nSo, what’s the buttom line? Do we have a double? Can our opponent take?\nApplying the Janowski formulas, we get take points for Black, and take points for White for the potential recube, as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nTaker, points away\nDoubler, points away\nCube value\nDead-cube take point\nLive-cube take point\nReal-cube take point\n\n\n\n\n4\n7\n2\n0.3776\n0.3776\n0.3776\n\n\n7\n4\n1\n0.4345\n0.2704\n0.3229\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the last row we see that Black as a very high take point, 0.4345, for the reason mentioned: The likely gammon will lose the match. Should Black turn the match around, however, White also has a high takepoint, 0.3776, and since the cube would be dead, the live-cube takepoint is the same as the dead-cube takepoint. For that reason, Black’s live-cube and real-cube takepoints are much lower: The model suggests Black would be able to take with a winning probability of 0.3229.\nGNU BG reports the exact same dead-cube takepoint, which is not surprising.\nThe live-cube take point, or “Fully live” as GNU BG calls it, is however a bit different: GNU BG reports 0.3012, rather than the 0.2704 that I get. It is unclear why this discrepancy arises: We got the same live-cube take points in the no-gammons example above. Introducing gammons shouldn’t really change anything, as they are factored into the risks and gains. Since the dead-cube takepoints are identical, that part must be correct.\nThe cube is dead after a future redouble, and we agree that White’s takepoint would then be 0.3776, so also the business about future takepoints can’t explain the discrepancy. A bit of a mystery.\nOf course, the real-cube takepoint I get, is affected by the lower live-cube takepoint. GNU BG doesn’t report a real-cube takepoint equivalent, so it is unclear what it thinks that would be. I suppose it would be \\(0.32 \\times 0.4345 + 0.3012 \\times 0.68 = 0.3439\\) because as mentioned earlier, the real-cube take point is just a weighted average of the dead-cube and the live-cube takepoints, with weights 0.32 and 0.68 respectively.\nThe takepoint I get, \\(TP_{real} = 0.3229\\), would suggest Black has a smallish take, since he is winning with probability 0.3396. GNU BG’s assumed takepoint of 0.3439 seems to indicate a smallish pass. Asked to evaluate the proper cube action, however, GNU BG says White has a 0.0320 take. So it must think you can take a position like this with winning chances of 0.3396.\nFor the record, a rollout has Black winning (after double and take) with probability 0.3407, and a normalized equity of -0.9619, so indeed a smallish take."

Some positions (like opening plays) appear several times; the total number of unique positions is 39261\nThe positions are taken from a total of 892 games, from a total of 343 matches.\nThe number of actual errors, the positions that we will consider here, are the decisions where someone (me or my opponent) made a checker play error or cube decision error. This comes to a total of 9460 mistakes, 4120 of which was made by me, 5340 by one of my 280 opponents.\n\nAll positions have been analyzed by GNU Backgammon 4-ply (equivalent to eXtreme Gammon 5-ply).\nThe data is available on GitHub, as a part of an R-package that I use as toolbox for backgammon related analyses."

The left, middle, and right panel in the plot below shows counts, sums, and averages.\n\n\n\n\n\nLuckily, it looks like I make fewer and smaller errors than my opponents on Backgammon Galaxy, but that is not surprising: I never use a rating filter, and therefore my opponents are of all skill levels, including beginners.\nNote that the errors are not directly comparable to the performance rating, PR, that Galaxy reports. The averages shown are the average size of errors, not averages across all non-obvious plays like XG defines it.\nAnyway, it does look like I have plenty of room for improvement. Can we figure out what areas to focus on?\nFor one thing, checker play errors taken together, seem to sum to a lot more than all cube errors. This is because there are so many checker play decisions, many of them resulting in small errors. The average cube error is more than double of the average checker play error.\nGiven that it would be hard to weed out all the checker plays that GNU BG considers small errors, it might be just as good to focus on the fewer but heavier cube errors.\nLet’s split by size of the error made, to see just how much the many small errors account for, compared to the fewer biggies."

And about half the checker play errors could be eliminated if I didn’t make blunder at 0.1 and above. Presumably the biggest ones are the easiest to get rid of, so it makes sense to focus on blunders, as many players do.\nNote that there’s a significant fat tail of blunders at 0.3 and above. Many of those may have to do with oversights, misclicks, time-pressure, losing interest, etc. So perhaps a low hanging fruit would be to just improve focus and concentration.\nSimilar for cube actions; there seem to be a good chunk of huge blunders that I should be able to get rid of. The small cube errors are maybe not worth worrying too much about. One reason is that in case of doubles, sometimes it pays to play the opponent: A incorrect double can be profitable if the opponent responds by an even bigger error. (More on incorrect takes/passes from opponents later)."

That class of cube positions are both frequent and with large, average errors. The mistake, however, can be both me doubling when I shouldn’t, or me passing a no-double (which of course is always very bad).\nLet’s further split by what the actual action was, so try to nail it better.\n\n\n\n\n\nI looks like the single biggest contributor to my cube mistakes, is me doubling or re-doubling when the position isn’t strong enough. (The big green bar in the middle panel.) Do I double too aggressively? Maybe, but on the other hand if you add together the cases where I rolled but should have doubled (the two purple bars in the middle panel) they represent also a big sum, so sometimes I miss a good double double too.\nStill, the wrong doubles, contribute more to the total sum of errors that the missed doubles.\nAlso, my wrong passes are relatively few and small: I lose more by incorrectly taking, than by incorrectly passing. In other words I might be a bit too optimistic about my own position: Taking too much rather than too little, and doubling a bit too early rather that too late.\nAll in all I might have to be a bit more conservative with the cube. (But don’t overdo it now, I don’t need more wrong passes or late doubles.)"

    "text": "When it pays to be wrong\nThis is an interesting class of mistakes, when I double positions that I shouldn’t have, but are then rewarded when my opponent incorrectly passes a no-double, or takes a too-good-double. ### Too good\nThe data has 39 examples of me doubling a position that is technically too good. The average error in these cases is -0.13. However, in 8 of those cases, my opponent accepted, for a huge, average error of -0.75. That makes the total, average error made by my opponents after I incorrectly double a too-good position -0.15. It is a very small sample, but it appears that those 39 errors could have been profitable overall.\nWe could do statistical tests to better access if this result is just noise, but it is more fun to plot the data to get a feel for how to interpret it.\nOne way to visualize the distribution of my double-errors vs my opponent’s take-errors, is to plot the estimated density distributions of errors like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother way to look at it would be to plot the size of my error of doubling, against the error of my opponent. In case of a correct response, a pass, that error would just be zero. Like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe point here is, that the bigger the no-double is, the bigger is also the potential gain from an erroneous take. While those big take-blunders may be less likely, the gain when they do happen is also bigger. The plot shows one outlier, bottom left corner, of a really big no-double that was accepted for a big gain.\nIt’s possible that best practical strategy is to never play on for too-good, unless it is absolutely obvious, like when you’re cruising home with a couple of opponent checkers closed out. It will most often cost something to double, because usually the opponent correctly passes, but the occasional big blunder take might outweigh that.\n\nNot good enough\nFor these pair of decisions, the data has 95 examples of me doubling a position that is technically not good enough. The average error in these cases is -0.14. In 9 of those cases, my opponent passed, for an average error of -0.36. That makes the total, average error made by my opponents after I incorrectly double a no-double position -0.03. It is still a small sample, but it appears that those 95 errors was not justified by a subsequent opponent error.\nLet’s do plot similar to before. First, the estimated density distributions of errors:\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, the scatter plot:"

    "text": "Appendix: Compare plies\nWhen you analyze this many positions, computing time is an issue. Are higher plies worth the extra time spent? Do we get different results between 0-ply and 4-ply? Can it be worthwhile to go 5-ply?\n\nSome overall results\nLet’s reproduce the first three charts from this report, split by ply, and inspect the results. First we have the overall results (like in the Me vs The Galaxy-section). For readability, instead of splitting on me vs opponent, we look at just my errors, but split by ply number.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom casual inspection, it looks like 0- and 1-ply are different, but 2-, 3-, and 4-ply produce mostly similar results on the aggregated level. 4-ply does have a slightly lower count of cube errors than 3-ply, and so a bit higher average cube error.\nIt’s hard to see that as a systematic sign of better evaluations, though. But the average estimated cube error does seem to grow by ply, with the exception of 3-ply.\nSame overall impression from the split by error size: 0- and 1-ply stand out a bit; otherwise little noticeable difference.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the cube-error plot again 0- and 1-ply stand out, and in general the bars look a little more noisy – but that is to be expected as the data set for cube actions is considerably smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll-in all no obvious reasons to invest computer time in doing 5-ply. The 4-ply analysis took abut 3 days, so a 5-ply would take months – we really would need a tangible reason to do that.\nFor fun, let’s examine some cases where 3-ply and 4-ply disagree the most. We pull out 20 examples, 10 checker play mistakes and 10 cube errors, in each case with 5 positions where 3-ply says the error made is bigger than 4-ply thinks, and 5 cases vice versa.\nThe stand-out pattern is, that we have many backgame position types. Other than that, there’s not a signal there that I can easily spot.\n\n\n\nPosition 1: Checker play\n\n\n\n\n\nSize of error, 3-ply: -0.259\nSize of error, 4-ply: -0.16\nDifference          : -0.099\nXGID                : XGID=--aBBBDbA---ca----bcc-B-B-:0:0:-1:21:0:2:0:5:10\n\n 1.

    "text": "Introduction\nIn backgammon money games mistakes are usually evaluated in terms of equities, \\(E\\), or expected value. \\(E=0\\) means that the game is even. Equities are typically normalized so the level of the cube and the stakes are not reflected in the size of mistakes: \\(E=0.1\\) means that the expected value of a position is one tenth of the cube value. If you made a \\(0.05\\) error, your position’s expected value just dropped by five percent of the cube value.\nIn match play, the natural unit of measurement is match winning chances, mwc. For example, trailing 3-away, 2-away, sometimes written as (-3,-2), yields \\(mwc=0.40\\), assuming strong, equal players. Unless otherwise noted, all mentioned equities are from the Kazaross XG2 match equity table, used as default by eXtreme Gammon (XG).\nThe \\(mwc\\) at stake varies by score. At double match point, a one point gain is worth \\(0.5\\ mwc\\), the difference between an even game, \\(mwc=0.50\\) and a sure victory, \\(mwc=1.00\\). At the beginning of a 17-point match one point is worth only about \\(0.04\\ mwc\\).\nIn a sense, double match point is like playing for $10 per point, compared to $0.8 per point at the beginning of the match.\nAlso, the value of one point is different for the leader and the trailer; at (-3,-2) one point is worth \\(0.10\\ mwc\\) for the trailer but \\(0.15\\ mwc\\) for the leader."

    "text": "EMG normalization\nAs mentioned, in money game we often like to compare errors without considering the level of the cube and the stakes. We rarely say things like “Taking that three-roll position cost me about $4.5 because the cube was at 4 and we played for $10 per point.” It is more common to say that the take is a 0.15 error.\nThis way, we can compare conceptual errors by abstracting away the specifics. If you would like the actual cost of taking, you would multiply the 0.15 error by the cube value and the stakes.\nLikewise, it can be useful to normalize match play errors, so that we can compare them to money game, and so we can compare errors across scores. If some error loses \\(0.03\\ mwc\\) at (-4, -5), but only \\(0.01\\ mwc\\) at (-17, -10) is that because the first score is closer to the end of the match, where points are more valuable, or is it because the first error is a bigger one, conceptually? And how big would the same mistake have been in a money game?\nThis is where emg (Equivalent to Money Game) comes in. The idea is to scale the difference between losing a single point and winning a single point in a match to the interval \\([-1;+1]\\), that we use in money game.\nFor example, at (-3,-7) the leader has \\(mwc\\) of about \\(0.76\\). If he loses one point and gets to (-3,-6) that drops to \\(0.71\\). If he wins one point for (-2,-7) that rises to \\(0.84\\). The range is \\([0.71;0.84]\\), and the difference between winning and losing a single point is \\(0.84-0.71 = 0.13\\). We can scale any \\(mwc\\) value to the corresponding money interval \\([-1;+1]\\) like this:\n\\[emg =\\frac{mwc-0.71}{0.13}\\times{2}-1\\]\nSo the \\(emg\\) for our minimal value of \\(mwc=0.71\\) becomes:\n\\[emg =\\frac{0.71-0.71}{0.13}\\times{2}-1=-1\\]\nAnd for our maximum value of \\(mwc=0.84\\) we get:\n\\[emg =\\frac{0.84-0.71}{0.13}\\times{2}-1=+1\\] Of course, with the doubling cube and gammons, you can be even worse off and end up outside the interval, like if you’re sure to lose a gammon and \\(E=-2.00\\).\nMore generally, if \\(mwc_{min}\\) is the match winning chance a player has after losing the cube value, and \\(mwc_{max}\\) is the corresponding chance after winning the cube value, then we can calculate \\(emg\\) from any \\(mwc\\) at any score like this:\n\\[emg =\\frac{mwc-mwc_{min}}{mwc_{max}-mwc_{min}}\\times{2}-1\\]\nSo if we lead (-3,-7) and mess up the opening roll so our \\(mwc\\) drops from \\(0.76\\) to \\(0.75\\), then the size of the error in \\(emg\\) would be:\n\\[emg =\\frac{0.75-0.71}{0.13}\\times{2}-1=-0.38\\]\nThis also means that the leader’s \\(emg\\) at the beginning of the game is negative:\n\\[emg =\\frac{0.76-0.71}{0.13}\\times{2}-1=-0.23\\]\nThat seems a little funny. The reason is, that in some sense the leader is closer to losing the game that to winning, since the gain by winning is much bigger than the loss from losing. The leader is not in the middle, but closer to the lower end of the interval \\([-1;1]\\).\nThis is just one counter-intuitive thing about emg normalization; there are more:"

    "text": "The problem\nSometimes, the \\(emg\\) appears really broken. Take a pure three-roll position where the non-roller has winning probability, \\(P(w)\\) of:\n\\[\nP(w) = \\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{1}{6}\\times\\frac{5}{6}\\ + \\ \\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{5}{6}\\times\\frac{1}{6} = 0.212\n\\] Consider two cases of such a position:\n\nYou’re being doubled trailing (-3,-2)\nYou’re being redoubled when tied (-3,-3)\n\nIn both cases you can take for the match (possibly via an automatic redouble), and get \\(mwc = 0.212\\). Or you can pass and get to (-3,-1) which is \\(mwc=0.249\\) The two cases appear identical. You’re better of passing. Taking would cost \\(0.249-0.212 = 0.037\\ mwc\\) in both situations.\nBut plucking the two cases into our \\(emg\\) formula we get:\n\n\\(emg =\\frac{0.21219-0.24924}{0.5-0.24924}\\times{2}-1=-1.296\\)\n\\(emg =\\frac{0.21219-0.24924}{0.75076-0.24924}\\times{2}-1=-1.148\\)\n\nSo at (-3,-2) the mistake of taking comes to a \\(-0.296\\  emg\\) error; at (-3,-3) what appears to be an identical mistake comes to a \\(-0.148\\  emg\\) error.\nYou can set up a pure three-roll position in XG and confirm that these are indeed the reported emg errors when accepting a (re-)double at those two scores.\nWhat’s going on?\nInspecting the emg formula, it isn’t that hard to figure out: The \\(0.037\\ mwc\\) error just looks smaller when you put it in the wide interval between losing and winning you get at (-3,-3) with cube at 2, compared to the more narrow interval at (-3,-2), cube at 1. As noted, the mwc interval in the two cases are \\([0.25;0.50]\\) and \\([0.25;0.75]\\) respectively.\nIt is counter intuitive, however, and you wonder if emg fails after all to be useful for comparing errors across scores, and between match play and money games.\nOn the other hand: Perhaps this is exactly what we want emg to do: A \\(0.037\\ mwc\\) error is easier to make at the end of the match, and therefore perhaps shouldn’t count as heavily. Just like a $1 mistake is small when playing for $100 per point, but big when playing for $2 per point.\nWe can note, like Bagai did in his paper, that a similar observation can be made when you are being doubled to 8 (in the same three-roll position) at (-3,-5). You can again choose between trailing (-3,-1) with \\(0.249\\ mwc\\) or playing for the match with \\(0.212\\ mwc\\), which would be a \\(0.037\\ mwc\\) error. This time the interval is even wider, so the emg normalized error by taking comes to \\(-0.099\\). This can be checked with XG.\nWe can also do a plot similar to the one Bagai showed, to visualize why the normalizations must necessarily result in different emg-values.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot shows three lines, one for each of the three cases. They all pass through the point where \\(mwc = 0.25\\) and \\(emg = -1.0\\) since losing the cube value in all cases results in (-3,-1) with \\(mwc = 0.25\\). Winning the cube value would result in mwc-values of \\(0.5; 0.75; 1.00\\) respectively.\nThe emg-values obtained by erroneously taking the cube (left-most data points) are all below \\(-1.0\\ emg\\) since in all three cases we have a pass. But they cannot be equal, like we might intuitively expect, since the transformation is linear, and the three lines have different slopes."

    "section": "More scores",
    "text": "More scores\nLet’s look at the size of the error by taking the same three-roll position for more scores, to get a feel for how the emg normalization in general compares to raw mwc.\nThe money benchmark is the error of accepting a three-roll position, which is easy to calculate, since for money there can’t be any proper recubes. The three-roll position has an expected money game value of \\(E = 2P(w) - 1 = -0.576\\) for the non-roller. So after accepting an initial double, the non-roller faces an average loss of \\(2\\times -0.576=-1.151\\) and the position is a money pass, since the loss of one point is just \\(-1\\). The size of the take error is \\(-0.151\\) (times the cube, times the stake, if you want the loss in real money).\nThe chart below shows the size of the error of accepting an initial double in a pure three-roll position, at all pre-crawford scores in a 9-point match. Errors are nomalized to emg, as explained above.\n(Note that on the x-axis, negative values are the real errors; a positive value is the margin by which the take is correct.)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the chart shows, at six scores the three-roll position is actually a take. The biggest take is, not surprisingly, at (-4,-2) where the non-roller has an automatic redouble that activates exactly the four points needed to win. Also, in some cases, when the non-roller needs two or three points, the high value of those points is enough to turn the position into a take.\nThe biggest passes are at (-4,-3) and (-2,-2), ignoring that in the later case one player would usually already have doubled by now. In general, the biggest passes are when the roller needs two, three or four points to win. In these cases, a two-point win is particularly valuable.\nIn about half of all scores the error from taking is bigger than for money, in the other half smaller, when we use the emg normalization to compare.\nBut we really wanted to figure out if the emg normalization was a good or a bad idea to begin with. So let’s show a similar plot with emg and mwc errors side-by-side:\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two plots show similar over-all patterns, but also some differences. Of course, both metrics agree on what scores produce takes; when one is negative the other is also, by definition.\nThe mwc-metric has the biggest error at (-2,-2); emg says this honor goes to (-4,-3). In a way, what emg says is this: ‘Yeah alright, taking at (-2,-2) is a big mistake. But part of the reason is, that there is so much mwc at stake at that score already. Any mistake is bound to be big. So we should adjust for that.’\nBut should we? It is hard to say. You could argue that conceptually the take is a bigger mistake at (-2,-2) because the score is special. Same thing could be said of (-2,-3) and (-3,-2) where emg also gives a different ranking.\nLet’s do a few more plots to see if we can nail this better.\nThis one shows the same data, but plotted differently, with mwc at the x-axis, and emg at the y-axis.\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the plot shows the same data some of the same things also stand out: (-2,-2) is a bit of an outlier; at (-4,-2) the non-roller has a big take. In general, there’s a reasonable correlation between mwc and emg. It’s worth pointing out that we don’t want a perfect correlation: If all points where placed exactly at the light green trend line, then mwc and emg would be equivalent, same thing on different scales, like Fahrenheit and Celsius. The idea is that emg should be different from mwc, more meaningful, more interpretable.\nLet’s do the same plot but with more scores: All combinations from a full 25-point match. (We leave out the (-2,-2) oddball, to give more plotting space to the more ‘normal’ cases.)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, the correlation breaks down. In particular, for the very lopsided scores like (-25,-2) and (-18,2), the mwc at stake becomes tiny, so the margin by which the take is correct, is also small. At all the lopsided scores the non-roller appears to have a small take as measured by mwc.\nThe emg error, on the other hand, is a bit different at (-25,-2) compared to (-18,-2) for example. Just as emg tries to adjust for scores with a lot of mwc at stakes, it also adjust for very little mwc at stake, thus magnifying small mwc’s.\nAgain, it is debatable if this is really desired behavior or not."

    "text": "Checker play errors\nOne final experiment before we wrap this up. As we have seen, part of the reason that the emg transformation can give surprising results, is that take errors are extrapolated outside the \\([mwc_{min};mwc_{max}]\\) interval that we use for normalization. A take error results in mwc smaller than a ordinary loss of the cube value, \\(mwc_{min}\\).\nChecker play errors, on the other hand, are differences between mwc’s, and the are usually not that big (except in extreme cases).\nLet’s consider a toy example: A last-roll bearoff where one player has two checkers left, one on the six point, one on the three point, with a two to play. The opponent owns the cube and has four checkers on her one point. The player has two options for his two:\n\n6/4, for \\(p(w) = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{17}{36} = 0.394\\), and \\(E = 2P(w) - 1 = -0.212\\)\n3/1, for \\(p(w) = \\frac{5}{6} \\times \\frac{15}{36} = 0.347\\), and \\(E = 2P(w) - 1 = -0.306\\)\n\nFor money, 3/1 would be a \\(-0.306 + 0.212 = -0.094\\) error.\nAt double match point, 3/1 would be a \\(0.347 - 0.394 = -0.047\\ mwc\\) error.\nSince 6/4 of course would be correct at all scores, and it is fair to say that 3/1 is the same conceptual error at all scores, we would like the emg transformation to produce the same value, no matter the score. One way to think of this: Suppose you’re browsing your matches for bear-off checker play errors, in order to fine tune your skill in that department. Then you would like to flag errors both early and late in the match. But the mwc-error from playing 3/1 at (-1,-1) is 16 times bigger than at (-25,-25).\nIt’s reasonable to think that playing 3/1 shouldn’t be disregarded as an error, just because it happened at (-25,-25) rather that at (-1,-1).\nTo achieve this, we really need some kind of normalization; looking at mwc will tend to miss errors early in a long match.\nDoes emg work for this purpose? I think it should, based on the plots and formulas above, but just in case I’m missing something, let’s try to calculate the size of the error of playing 3/1 at all scores, in emg and in mwc:\n\n\n\n\n\nAs expected, emg normalizes the error of playing 3/1 to \\(-0.0926\\) for all scores. (This value is a little off from the earlier mentioned \\(-0.094\\) because of rounding error in that manual calculation.) We see how the mwc error is high near the end of the match, lower at the beginning. (-25,-25) is not the very rightmost data point, because for these scores the mwc-errors are tiny, and the exact value depends on rounding and precision of the match equity table."

    "text": "Dagens position er usædvanlig på flere måder: For det første er Sort i et 1-2-bagspil hvilket man ikke ser så ofte. For det andet er det lykkedes for Sort på uheldig vis at kombinere bagspillet med to malplacerede brikker på 3- og 1-punktet. For det tredje er GNU Backgammon og eXtreme Gammon enige om, at det bedste træk med 62 er klokkeklart. Desværre er de to programmer uenige om, hvad det bedste træk egentlig er.\nSort har en række muligheder med 62, og det kan være svært at vælge. Hvis man som jeg lærte at spille backgammon i slut 1980’erne, er der én ting som ligger helt fast: Det kan ikke komme på tale at spille 3/1 med 2’eren. Dengang, før computerne, lærte vi, at det var bedre at brække armen på langs end at lave sit 1-punkt i backgammon. Skete det, kunne man praktisk talt lige så godt give op. Og hvis man som Sort har et bagspil så er det endnu værre at lave 1-punktet, for man har brug for alle mand til at holde de bagerste punkter med, mens man samtidig bygger en blokade foran Hvid, så et eventuelt senere hit vinder.\nDesværre føler GNU Backgammon, selv på 4-ply (svarende til XG’s 5-ply), at langt det bedste træk i stillingen er begyndertrækket: 24/18* 3/1.\nPersonligt ville jeg have foretrukket det enkle 24/18*/16* som på en virkelig god dag giver Sort mulighed for at vinde ved at gå fremad: Pumpe brikker ud i outfield’en og slå Hvid hjem igen og igen. Svigter planen (hvad den som regel gør), kan Sort altid falde tilbage på sit bagspil.\nDer er også mulighed for det virkelig kreative 24/18* 6/4*, måske Sorts bedste change for nogensinde i sit liv at bygge en 6-punkts prime fra 8-punktet til 13-punktet. Hvem kan modstå fristelsen for en once-in-a-lifetime mulighed?\nEndelig er der mellemting som 24/18* 13/11 eller 24/18* 8/6.\nKan man forestille sig, at GNU’s begyndertræk er det rigtige? Ved nærmere eftertanke er det måske ikke så dumt: Selvom det er at foretrække at bygge primen i rækkefølge, kan det vel også lade sig gøre at vinde med en lidt mere uordenligt blokade?\nMen det her er jo en julehistorie, så den ender godt. Efter alt at dømme er 24/18*/16* alligevel det bedste træk – det er i hvert fald hvad XG får mest ud af i en stærk rollout. Selvom GNU Backgammon så vidt jeg ved efterhånden spiller næsten lige så godt som XG, så er denne stilling et blindt punkt. Det bliver ikke meget bedre af at at kigge nogle rul frem med 4-ply, for stillingen ligner sig selv også fire rul senere.\nDe kreative eller ekstremt kreative træk er heller ikke gode, hvilket på sin vis er lidt ærgerligt. Men 1-punktet er er altså den forkerte ide – men måske ikke helt lige så slemt som at brække armene på langs.\nMatchstillingen her er 0-0 til 3, lidt anderledes end money game, men ikke nok til at ændre det store billede.\nHer er rollout’en.\n\n\n1.

    "text": "The rounding problem\nHere’s one example that is fairly straight forward. You’re in the beginning of a 17-point match, off for a bad start, trailing 0-5 or 17-away, 12-away, or (-17,-12). You’re facing a double in a bearoff that you consider a borderline take/pass for money.\nPerhaps something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nShould trailing as white make you more or less inclined to accept a double from black?\nFor simplicity let’s do the calculations assuming no redoubles, since this example is a bearoff with no recube potential anyway. Using the Kazaross XG2 match equity table, with full six digit precision, the calculation goes like this.\n\nA pass means (-17,-11), \\(mwc=0.2647\\)\nTaking and winning means (-15, -12), \\(mwc=0.374741\\), for a gain of: \\(0.374741-0.2647 = 0.110041\\)\nTaking and losing means (-17,-10), \\(mwc=0.22625\\), for a loss of: \\(0.2647 - 0.22625 = 0.03845\\)\n\\(Take\\ point = \\frac{loss}{loss+gain} = \\frac{0.03845}{0.03845 + 0.110041} = 0.2589383\\)\n\nYour take point is a bit higher than for money, you should be less inclined to take; so you probably have a pass if this is borderline for money.\nBut of course, nobody can do calculations like this with six digits over the board. If you’re a really good tournament player, you might attempt doing the same calculations rounded to two digits (whole percentages).\nLet’s see how that would play out:\n\nA pass means (-17,-11), \\(mwc=0.26\\)\nTaking and winning means (-15, -12), \\(mwc=0.37\\), for a gain of: \\(0.37-0.26 = 0.11\\)\nTaking and losing means (-17,-10), \\(mwc=0.23\\), for a loss of: \\(0.26 - 0.23 = 0.03\\)\n\\(Take\\ point = \\frac{loss}{loss+gain} = \\frac{0.03}{0.03 + 0.11} = 0.2142857\\)\n\nNow, you reach the opposite conclusion: Your take point is considerably lower than the well-known \\(0.25\\) cubeless take point for money. You might well have a clear take.\nLooking at the calculations, we see that they are impacted heavily by a couple of rounding errors: The equity from passing and getting to (-17, -11) gets rounded down; the equity from taking and winning gets rounded up so the total \\(mwc\\) loss from taking (and being wrong) is only about \\(0.03\\), almost a full percentage point lower that the \\(0.038\\) we get using all digits.\nFinally, that lower number goes into both the numerator and the denominator, of the take point calculation, impacting the take point in a big way."

    "text": "How common is this?\nDid I cherry pick this example? Well, yes, but the cherry wasn’t hard to find. Let’s look at more examples.\n\nSimple take points\nFor starters, here’s a plot showing more cubeless, gammonless take points, when the player being doubled is 17-away.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome observations:\n\nNot surprisingly, you have a low take point, around \\(0.19\\), when the opponent needs just two points to win, and you have an automatic redouble available.\nSame thing when the opponent needs three points and you’re kind of desperate.\nYou have a much higher take point when the opponent needs four, because the extra two point at stake are very valuable for the opponent.\nThe same holds, but to a smaller and smaller degree, when the opponent needs 6, 8 or 10 points to win.\n\nLet’s extend the plot to cover more scores:\n\n\n\n\n\nSome observations:\n\nIn general, for this kind of doubles (initial, cubeless, gammonless) it is easier, not harder, to accept a double if you are leading.\nThe exception is if the opponent needs only two or three points while having a big lead. Here, you’re near dead if you lose anyway, so take points are low.\nThe very highest take point we find at (-4,-3): \\(0.352\\) At this score you’re often better off passing and getting to the notorious (-4,-2) where you can double very aggresively and try to win the match with a gammon.\n\n\n\nWith rounding errors\nBut the goal was to examine the impact of rounding errors. Let’s go back to the 17-away take points from the first diagram, and experiment with the number of digits we use for calculating take points.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that the 2-digit calculations are often off by a fair amount. The (-17,-12) example I mentioned earlier, is not the only one.\nLet’s extend this again with many small plots for different scores:\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the chart it is pretty evident that two-digit precision just doesn’t cut it for calculating these kind of take points: They are all over the place, basically.\nAcross all scores, the average absolute difference between take points with two-digit precision and six-digit precision is: 0.041\nThe distribution of differences looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that is is very common for the two-digit take point to be off by a couple of percentage points; sometimes as much as five percentage points.\n(In some extreme cases the difference between two-digit and six-digit take points can be as high as \\(0.78\\); this is because of scores like (-2,-23) where the leader’s rounded \\(mwc\\) is \\(1.00\\) even after passing; there’s no measurable gain from taking and winning, so the take point becomes \\(1.00\\)).\n\n\nWith gammons\nBefore we wrap up, let’s have a look at how take points with and without rounding error look when we also have gammons and backgammons. We use gammon and backgammon frequencies, that is, the proportion of games won or lost, that result in a gammon or backgammon. For illustration, we use frequencies similar to what can be expected at the beginning of a money game:\n\nPlayer’s gammon frequency: \\(0.26\\)\nPlayer’s backgammon frequency: \\(0.012\\)\nOpponent’s gammon frequency: \\(0.26\\)\nOpponent’s gammon frequency: \\(0.012\\)\n\nA plot similar to the one earlier, this time comparing take points with and without gammons, 2- and 6-digit precision, when 17-away, vs. opponent score:\n\n\n\n\n\nFor gammonish positions the take points tend to increase with size of lead, but using only two digits basically create so much noise to that the calculations are meaningless.\nFunny enough, it seems that the noise is actually sightly smaller when working with positions where gammons and backgammons are possible. This is probably because the most destructive rounding errors then to be cancel out when we have more numbers involved.\nThe density plot of take point rounding errors confirm this:"

    "text": "A bit of theory\nLet’s revisit how and why the cube actions are different at 3-away, 3-away than for money. The 3-point match equity table looks like this:\n\n\n      1     2     3\n1 0.500 0.677 0.751\n2 0.323 0.500 0.599\n3 0.249 0.401 0.500\n\n\nIn the simple case, not considering gammons and recubes, when we pass an initial double we get to 0.401 match winning chances, losing about 10 percentage points compared to when the game began. If we take, a loss is expensive, we get to 0.249 match winning chances, an additional loss of about 15 percentage points.\nSo the risk from taking and winning is 0.151, and the potential gain from taking and winning is 0.35 for a take point of 0.302, based on the standard formula: \\(TP= \\frac{Risk}{Gain + Risk}\\). So a pure 4-roll position, for example, would be a pass.\nAfter taking, the gammon value with the cube at 2, is 0.497, not much different from the money gammon value of 0.5, so adding gammons into the mix has about the same effect as in money game.\nAfter taking, the opponent’s take point for a future redouble, is just 0.249 which is higher than for money, since the cube would be dead. That means that the cube is a little more valuable to us than for money, because we don’t have to improve quite as much to use it efficiently.\nFor illustration purposes, let’s assume gammon- and backgammon probabilities that are similar to the opening position for money, like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegular\nGammon\nBackgammon\nSum\n\n\n\n\nPlayer wins\n0.36\n0.134\n0.006\n0.5\n\n\nOpponent wins\n0.36\n0.134\n0.006\n0.5\n\n\nSum\n0.72\n0.268\n0.012\n1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen, putting it all together, we can calculate take points under different assumptions, and compare to money in a nice table like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nCube assumptions\nMoney game take point\n3-away, 3-away take point\nDifference\n\n\n\n\nDead cube, no gammons\n0.250\n0.302\n0.052\n\n\nDead cube, gammons\n0.307\n0.345\n0.038\n\n\nBoth cube and gammons\n0.271\n0.286\n0.015\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSure enough, the table shows that the ‘simple’ take point (no gammons, no cube) that we just discussed, is significant higher at the score than for money. A little bit of the difference disappear when we introduce gammons; somewhat more when we introduce the cube.\nThe end result is that the take point at 3-away 3-away is about 1.5 percentage point higher than for money. It may not sound as much, but the difference is quite real, as the examples below will show."

So that means either on my first, second or third play – since I play either move 1, 3, 5 or 2, 4, 6, depending on who wins the opening roll.\nI split the mistakes into a simple structure: Positions are grouped by move number, and shown in descending order by the magnitude of the error. So the first example will the biggest error I ever made on the opening move – the last example will be the smallest error on the 6th move of the game (my third play after losing the opening roll). To limit the number of positions a bit, I pick only the top 20 errors within each move number.\nIt is an automated report, based on a collection of my online matches at Backgammon Galaxy.\nThe data was generated like this: First, I use a Python script for GNU Backgammon to analyze my collection of matches at 4-ply. Then, my R-package Backgammon contains a function turn the GNU BG analysis files into a data frame that can be analyzed using normal statistical tools. Finally, this Quarto notebook with R-code displays diagrams based on a subset of that data."
