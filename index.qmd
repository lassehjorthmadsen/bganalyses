This is my backgammon playground, where I keep some analyses related to backgammon. They help me wrap my head around stuff related to match theory, how [eXtreme Gammon](https://www.extremegammon.com/) works under the hood, and how match scores differ. 

The notes are mostly for my personal use, but I'm always open for discussions on how to approach these things. Do check out the side menu if you're curious, and feel free to [reach out](https://twitter.com/lassehmadsen), if you have comments or questions. 

My favorite tool is [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and so I have an [R-package](https://lassehjorthmadsen.github.io/backgammon/) in a repository on [Github](https://github.com/lassehjorthmadsen/backgammon) that I use for some of this. (This site, by the way, is also on [Github](https://github.com/lassehjorthmadsen/bganalyses).) 

Thanks,\
Lasse
