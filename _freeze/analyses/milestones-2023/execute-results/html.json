Every player gets to play 15 7-point matches. I will collect about one problem from each of my own matches: Positions where I made some mistake, that I found difficult, surprising or otherwise interesting.\n\nIn some cases, I show also variations, to better understand what is going on. I will organize the positions only into cube actions and checker plays, adding more as they come.\n\n## Cube actions\n\n### Position 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOver the board, this looked to me as a strong double. White has an excellent forward structure, a fat racing lead, and a four prime that can be extended from the back in relative safety, since Black has two checkers on the bar. The only weakness is White's blot on the ace point, but getting hit is not a big deal, so it can't be much of a liability. (Might it even be desirable to get hit, to have that checker recirculated back into action?)\n\nMeanwhile, Black has made almost no progress; only the 11-point is made.\n\nMy guess was a strong double, and a smallish take for Black. It is, however, the other way around: White has only a small double, Black has a huge take:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,690 (-0,047)\n       Double/Take:   +0,736\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,264)\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nTo see if this is match-score related, let's check the same position for money, and while we're at it, also check if XG Roller ++ (fast, truncated rollouts), gets it right, compared to a full rollout at strong settings. \n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,800 (-0,120)\n       Double/Take:   +0,920\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,080)\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\n       No double:     +0,784 (-0,134)\n       Double/Take:   +0,918\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,082)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor money, the double is bigger, and the take is smaller. It appears that the 2-point lead does make a difference. But why?\n\nTake points: Money and at-the-score\nDead cube, no gammons\nDead cube, gammons\nLive cube, gammons\n\n\n## Checker plays\n\n",
