Every player gets to play 15 7-point matches. I will collect about one problem from each of my own matches: Positions where I made some mistake, that I found difficult, surprising or otherwise interesting.\n\nIn some cases, I show also variations, to better understand what is going on. I will organize the positions only into cube actions and checker plays, adding more as they come.\n\n## Cube actions\n\n### Position 1\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOver the board, this looked to me like a strong double. White has an excellent forward structure, a fat racing lead, and a 4-point prime that can be extended from the back in relative safety, since Black has two checkers on the bar. The only weakness is White's blot on the ace point, but getting hit is not a big deal, so it can't be much of a liability.\n\nMeanwhile, Black has made almost no progress; only the 11-point is made.\n\nMy guess was a strong double, and a smallish take for Black. It is, however, the other way around: White has only a small double, Black has a huge take:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,690 (-0,047)\n       Double/Take:   +0,736\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,264)\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the outcome probabilities, we see that White does have a big gammon threat, but also that Black wins more than a third of the games:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Regular </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Gammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Backgammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Sum </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Player wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.292 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.340 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.024 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.656 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Opponent wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.265 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.072 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.007 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.344 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Sum </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.557 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.412 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.031 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 1.000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne thing that I might have overlooked here, is that White has very few real crushing frequencies, because he's a little short on ammo. Black will almost always make some kind of anchor, and then have some kind of counter play agains White's three back checkers.\n\nTo see if this result is match-score related, let's check the same position for money, and while we're at it, also check if XG Roller ++ (fast, truncated rollouts), gets it right, compared to a full rollout at strong settings.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,800 (-0,120)\n       Double/Take:   +0,920\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,080)\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\n       No double:     +0,784 (-0,134)\n       Double/Take:   +0,918\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,082)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor money, the double is bigger, and the take is smaller, so more in line with my first impression. It appears that the 2-point lead for White does make a difference.\n\nBut why?\n\nThe next table shows Black's takepoints under different assumption: No cube and no gammons (like a last-roll position); no cube and gammon rates from the table above; and finally taking both cube and gammons into account.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cube assumptions </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Moneygame takepoint </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 7-away, 5-away takepoint </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Difference </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dead cube, no gammons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.250 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.240 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> -0.010 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dead cube, gammons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.384 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.382 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> -0.002 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Both cube and gammons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.343 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.304 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> -0.039 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe last-roll takepoint is not too different from money at this score, and it also doesn't make much difference to factor in gammons. When we consider possible recubes, however, we see that Black's takepoint at the score, is somewhat lower than it would be for money.\n\nThis is because he'll redouble more aggressively at the score. We can see why, by looking at *White's* takepoints for a potential recube, assuming the same gammon frequencies:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cube assumptions </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Moneygame takepoint </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> 5-away, 7-away recube takepoint </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Difference </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dead cube, no gammons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.250 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.266 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.016 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dead cube, gammons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.264 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.333 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.069 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Both cube and gammons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.236 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.312 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.5cm; \"> 0.076 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSo, it looks like a good part of my flawed evaluation of the original position, comes from the fact that Black can take somewhat more aggressively at the score; hence White needs more to have a really strong double.\n\nThe reason for Black's lower takepoint at the score, lies mostly in the potential redouble in positions where gammons are possible: It's hard for White to accept a 4-cube at 5-away 7-away, where a gammon loss means is much more costly than a gammon win.\n\nStill, the position is also a clear take for money, so there's some reconsideration to do in that department too. What will it take to turn the position into a really tough take for money?\n\nIf we activate the awkward spare on the ace-point, we suddenly have a big pass. Perhaps not surprising, since the liability turns into a big asset. But still:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,979 (-0,021)\n       Double/Take:   +1,273 (+0,273)\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nEven if we put the spare checker in a less ideal place, we still get a double/pass:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,929 (-0,071)\n       Double/Take:   +1,045 (+0,045)\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThat spare has to move out of the action, to get to a marginal pass:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,913 (-0,087)\n       Double/Take:   +1,011 (+0,011)\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFinally, we get to a decent take, noting that Black is no longer far behind in the race:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,874 (-0,072)\n       Double/Take:   +0,947\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000 (+0,053)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne way to see how bad White's ace-point blot is, is to consider the original position after something like 31: 24/20. Now, most aces, like 21, 31, 41, and 51, are below-average rolls for Black, even though they hit. White is *hoping* to get hit (except with 41 and 11, trying for a high anchor); that's how bad the blot is.\n\nAnother experiment would be to improve White's opportunity to extend the prime from the back. A one-pip change can be huge: We go from a clear take to a pretty clear pass:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,856 (-0,144)\n       Double/Take:   +1,059 (+0,059)\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother change in the same spirit is to bring in another builder for that important 9-point. It has about the samme effect as slotting:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,854 (-0,146)\n       Double/Take:   +1,065 (+0,065)\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nA final one-pip change that has a rather dramatic effect, is to just semi-active the ace-point checker so it easier becomes part of a prime, and is both easier and more attractive to cover. Again, we go from a clear take to a clear pass:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n\nAnalyzed in XG Roller++\nCubeful Equities:\n       No double:     +0,849 (-0,151)\n       Double/Take:   +1,062 (+0,062)\n       Double/Pass:   +1,000\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSumming up:\n\n-   A two-point lead in a 7-point match matters, especially if you might face a recube when gammons are still possible.\n-   What seems to be a strong positional advantage, might not be so strong if there are also liabilities.\n-   An awkward ace-point blot can be a rather big liability\n-   Small things matter: One pip can make a it much easier to turn a strong position into a winning position.\n\n### Position 2\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-14-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis is another example of blitz that could work as a bluff double: It might look like White has a strong blitz going, but in fact the take is easy, and this is not even a double.

If we turn the slot into a builder White can both blitz or prime, and two strong game plans are much better than one.

So the extra builders on the 11- and 8-points have real value. \n\nNote that White should break the 13-point with a lot of rolls: 54, 43, 62, 42, 32, 51, and the 52 from the actual position.\n\n51 deserves special mention, the funny looking 13/7 is probably slightly better than the aggressive slot, 11/5, which accomplishes the same thing, but with a different risk/reward ratio: A lot more shots, and a lot more ways to make the 5-point if missed.\n\nThe shots left in the outfield is not the main concern: 43 should be played 13/10 13/9 with lots of builders at the cost of 5 shots; 43: 11/8, 11/7 would be a blunder even though it looks flexible.\n\nLikewise, with 32, 13/11, 13/10 is a lot better than 11/9, 11/8, since it creates four active builders for the 5-point rather than just three.\n\nSumming up, making the 5-point and a 5-point-prime is likely to win the game, and White can easily afford to break the midpoint and leave a few fly-shots to increase the probability of achieving that goal.\n\nBuilders win out -- *if* they aim at something important, and *if* they are not too likely to get hit.\n\n### Positions 2a-2d\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-2.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-3.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-25-4.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\nThese four positions share a common theme: The right play is hard to find for those of us who learned, back in the day, that the one thing you must never do in backgammon, is to make the ace-point.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPosition 2a\nXG Roller++ \n1. 5/1* 3/1     eq:+0,266\n2. 8/6 5/1*     eq:+0,215 (-0,051)\n3. 7/1*         eq:+0,204 (-0,062)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPosition 2b\nXG Roller++ \n1. 6/1* 2/1     eq:-0,324\n2. 8/7 6/1*     eq:-0,361 (-0,037)\n3. 24/23 6/1*   eq:-0,413 (-0,089)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPosition 2c\nXG Roller++ \n1. 8/6 2/1      eq:+0,178\n2. 8/5          eq:+0,130 (-0,048)\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nPosition 2d\nXG Roller++ \n1. 16/1         eq:+0,767\n2. 8/3*         eq:+0,754 (-0,013)\n3. 9/5 6/5      eq:+0,723 (-0,044)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nIn both cases White must hit, he has the stronger board and while it is not good to get hit back, Black can also do some damage if left alone.\n\nAfter hitting on the ace point, anything but switching point just leave another blot for no particular gain.\n\n### Position 3\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-27-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis is a technical play, where it is tempting to assume that all reasonable plays are close. Actually, they are not so close.\n\nObviously the play is all about getting off the gammon. Over the board, White played 19/9, thinking that it hardly mattered, as long as he made crossovers and avoided wastage by playing past the 6-point.\n\nThe gammon race is close. The probabilities that White will lose a gammon after the five best plays, are listed below. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1. 13/7 10/6    53.93% \n2. 19/13 10/6   55.07%\n3. 19/15 13/7   56.63%\n4. 19/9         57.74%\n5. 13/9 13/7    58,07%\n1296 Games rolled with Variance Reduction.\nMoves: 3-ply, cube decisions: XG Roller\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe actual play, 19/9, increases the risk of getting gammoned, by almost 4 percentage points, so for money that would be about a 0.04 mistake, costing 4 percent of the cube value -- a significant mistake.\n\nWhy so much?\n\nThe main concept in getting-off-the-gammon problems is to avoid \"wasting\" pips, by playing past the 6-point, those pips don't help saving the gammon. Playing 10/4 with the 4 does just that, so must be right. Indeed, 10/4 is part of both top plays. \n\nThis *is* quite important, especially when the gammon race is close.\n\nAfter 10/6 with the 4,  13/7 is best with the 6, simply because it creates a smaller stack: Two checkers on the 7- and 13-point, is better than one and four checkers.\n\n### Position 4\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](milestones-2023_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-29-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\nThis one is from the same game as position 3, but Black has rolled well, so White is now a big favorite to get gammoned. The 31 White has to play is a little funny, because the correct play seem to violate basic principles for getting off the gammon: Make crossovers; don't waste pips.\n\nThe right play is 8/5 8/7.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n[1] \"\\n    1.
