This can often be a difficult choice, so I thought it would be useful to take a closer look.\n\nWe have five main positions, each with several variants, all are rolled out 1296 times; moves and cube decisions at 3-ply.\n\n## Position 1\n\nIn the first two contrasting variants, hitting with 21 is clearly right, for all the usual reasons: It gains in the race, gains initiative, cuts down on Black's good numbers, leaves bad 6s from the bar.\n\n#### Variation A\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 13/10*           eq:+0,138\nPlayer:   52,70% (G:15,93% B:0,75%)\nOpponent: 47,30% (G:11,61% B:0,60%)\n\n2. 24/21      eq:+0,018 (-0,120)\nPlayer:   49,69% (G:11,01% B:0,34%)\nOpponent: 50,31% (G:7,46% B:0,27%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`XGID=-a----E-D-a-eD---c-e-A--A-:0:0:1:21:0:0:0:0:10`\n\nIn the second position, either of the pointing plays are a lot better that hitting.\n\n#### Variation B\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 8/5 6/5          eq:+0,239\nPlayer:   54,79% (G:17,12% B:0,74%)\nOpponent: 45,21% (G:9,91% B:0,37%)\n\n2. 24/20      eq:+0,186 (-0,053)\nPlayer:   53,47% (G:11,71% B:0,29%)\nOpponent: 46,53% (G:5,87% B:0,24%)\n\n3. RolloutÂ²    13/9*      eq:+0,134 (-0,105)\nPlayer:   52,80% (G:16,03% B:0,75%)\nOpponent: 47,20% (G:12,05% B:0,59%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhy the difference?\n\nLet's try to ignore the even stronger pointing play of 8/5 6/5 in variation B, and just compare the advanced anchor plays to the hitting plays.\n\nClearly, the 20-point is stronger than the 21-point, so that's a long term reason why pointing is more attractive in variation B than in variation A: The point we get to make is better.\n\nThere're also a related tactical reason: Leaving a blot on the 20-point in variation B gives Black nice, loose return hits with aces: 21, 31, 41, and 51 from the bar. In variation A the same aces are not nearly as comfortable after hitting. (The corresponding loose hits with 2s are not as clear and happy for Black.)\n\nAnother way of putting it: Hitting in variation A gives Black *both* poor 6s and aces from the bar; in variation B it is only 6s that are uncomfortable.\n\nFor these reasons, the defensive anchor works better that hitting i variation A but not in variation B.\n\nAs mentioned, B offers White an even stronger option: 8/5 6 /5. That's better because the 5-point is also a great point to make, *and* it's harder since it's not slotted like the 20-point is. So it makes sense to take the opportunity now, while the need for defense is not super urgent.\n\n## Position 2\n\n#### Variation A\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 23/20 6/5        eq:+0,557\nPlayer:   62,59% (G:18,02% B:0,71%)\nOpponent: 37,41% (G:6,52% B:0,28%)\n\n2. 13/9*      eq:+0,414 (-0,143)\nPlayer:   59,06% (G:20,49% B:1,62%)\nOpponent: 40,94% (G:11,74% B:0,61%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`XGID=-b---BD-Ca--cD---bbcA-bA--:0:0:1:13:0:0:0:0:10`\n\nIn position 2A, making the point with 23/20 6/5 is far ahead of the hitting play, 13/9\\*, for several reasons. Of course, the anchor is super strong, and a permanent asset. But that's always the case, and often hitting is stronger anyway. In this position specifically:\n\n-   The non-hitting play is nice and smooth\n-   The non-hitting play leaves no blots, avoiding 54 and 63 fly shots\n-   Hitting lets Black make an advanced anchor with 43 and 32\n-   Hitting lets Black return hit loose with 41 and 31 (much like in the previous position)\n\n#### Variation B\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 8/4 6/4          eq:+0,472\nPlayer:   60,45% (G:21,72% B:1,62%)\nOpponent: 39,55% (G:12,06% B:0,47%)\n\n2. 23/21 13/9*      eq:+0,423 (-0,049)\nPlayer:   59,54% (G:20,22% B:1,44%)\nOpponent: 40,46% (G:11,35% B:0,58%)\n\n3. 13/11 13/9*      eq:+0,399 (-0,072)\nPlayer:   58,74% (G:21,36% B:1,74%)\nOpponent: 41,26% (G:12,68% B:0,93%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`XGID=-b---BD-Ca--cD---bbcA-bA--:0:0:1:24:0:0:0:0:10`\n\nSame position, different roll, now with a choice of making the 4-point or hitting. Pointing is still right, but with a smaller margin, since the 4-point is not as urgent, and not as important as the 20-point anchor in the previous position.\n\n#### Variation C\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 23/21 13/10*     eq:+0,457\nPlayer:   60,45% (G:19,87% B:1,57%)\nOpponent: 39,55% (G:11,44% B:0,58%)\n\n2. 13/11 13/10*     eq:+0,424 (-0,033)\nPlayer:   59,11% (G:21,10% B:1,79%)\nOpponent: 40,89% (G:12,23% B:0,86%)\n\n3. 23/20 8/6        eq:+0,420 (-0,037)\nPlayer:   59,11% (G:17,36% B:0,61%)\nOpponent: 40,89% (G:7,19% B:0,30%)\n\n4. 13/10* 10/8      eq:+0,403 (-0,054)\nPlayer:   59,11% (G:19,61% B:1,33%)\nOpponent: 40,89% (G:11,19% B:0,47%)\n\n5. 23/20 13/11      eq:+0,397 (-0,060)\nPlayer:   58,87% (G:16,95% B:0,67%)\nOpponent: 41,13% (G:7,76% B:0,28%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`XGID=-b---BD-C-a-cD---bbcA-bA--:0:0:1:23:0:0:0:0:10`\n\nAlmost the same position; this time the anchoring play is a little awkward, and that is enough to make hitting correct, by a small amount.\n\n#### Variation D\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 9/4 6/4          eq:+0,423\nPlayer:   59,38% (G:20,66% B:1,37%)\nOpponent: 40,62% (G:12,40% B:0,56%)\n\n2. 20/15 13/11*     eq:+0,416 (-0,008)\nPlayer:   60,01% (G:20,37% B:1,57%)\nOpponent: 39,99% (G:13,02% B:0,89%)\n\n3. 13/8 13/11*      eq:+0,389 (-0,035)\nPlayer:   58,76% (G:20,90% B:1,73%)\nOpponent: 41,24% (G:12,24% B:0,85%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`XGID=-b---BD-BA-acD---bbcA-bA--:0:0:1:25:0:0:0:0:10`\n\nVariation D is a photo finish: The pointing play cleans up a blot and is super smooth, the hitting play unstacks the mid and is very flexible. The hit has all the usual benefits, while the inner point takes a lot of the sting out of any loose hit from Black.\n\nBottom line: The two plays are basically equal.\n\n#### Variation E\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 23/20 7/5        eq:+0,515\nPlayer:   61,14% (G:19,33% B:0,67%)\nOpponent: 38,86% (G:6,94% B:0,29%)\n\n2. 7/4 6/4          eq:+0,435 (-0,080)\nPlayer:   59,61% (G:21,34% B:1,48%)\nOpponent: 40,39% (G:12,48% B:0,56%)\n\n3. 13/10* 7/5       eq:+0,402 (-0,112)\nPlayer:   58,53% (G:21,25% B:1,69%)\nOpponent: 41,47% (G:11,84% B:0,68%)\n\n4. 13/10* 10/8      eq:+0,361 (-0,154)\nPlayer:   57,81% (G:19,84% B:1,53%)\nOpponent: 42,19% (G:11,58% B:0,55%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`XGID=-b---BDAB-a-cD---bbcA-bA--:0:0:1:23:0:0:0:0:10`\n\nIn variation E, if White plays 7/5 with the two, the best 3 is 23/20, making the achor, for the same reasons as seen earlier. The 20-point is simple very valueable, and Black would like to hit loose there, so making it takes priority. The play is also quite flexible, so beats hitting.\n\nBetween the two pointing plays, the anchor wins for the same reason as before: It is the better and more urgent point to make; the 4-point is likely to come later.\n\n#### Variation F\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 23/20 13/11*     eq:+0,464\nPlayer:   60,81% (G:19,52% B:1,50%)\nOpponent: 39,19% (G:11,05% B:0,49%)\n\n2. 23/21 13/10      eq:+0,433 (-0,030)\nPlayer:   59,47% (G:18,57% B:0,73%)\nOpponent: 40,53% (G:8,19% B:0,34%)\n\n3. 13/10 13/11*     eq:+0,404 (-0,059)\nPlayer:   59,19% (G:20,57% B:1,50%)\nOpponent: 40,81% (G:12,62% B:0,86%)\n\n4. 13/11* 11/8      eq:+0,398 (-0,066)\nPlayer:   58,75% (G:19,49% B:1,25%)\nOpponent: 41,25% (G:11,55% B:0,50%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`XGID=-b---BD-C--acD---bbc-AbA--:0:0:1:23:0:0:0:0:10`\n\nWhen the point to make is a slightly inferior anchor, the scales tip again and hitting is best, by a small amount, noting that 23/21 13/11\\* makes a bid for the better anchor *while* hitting.\n\n## Position 3\n\nThese four variations are mostly close, with the anchor play usually winning by a small margin (except in the last position, variation D).\n\n#### Variation A\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1.

Then, White has a choice of anchoring with 24/20 or hitting with 11/7\\*. Probably largely for the reasons we saw earlier -- White doesn't want Black to play an ace from the bar 6/5\\*, unstacking -- the anchor is best. But it is pretty close, since hitting has some good benefits as well (like 4 dancing numbers).\n\n#### Variation B\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1.

Anchoring is still right, but by an even smaller amount, since the anchor is not quite as good.  \n\n#### Variation C\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1.

But note that the 20-point is still the stronger point, so making that anchor *without* hitting is close.\n\nA small experiment demonstrate that point: If White, after playing bar/21 9/4\\*, is allowed to slide the 21-point anchor to the 20-point, the gain is about 0,075 cubeful equity, Black on roll. That's about the amount it is worth to win an opening roll of 53: Very significant, though not overwhelming. \n\n#### Variation D\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1.

Unlike earlier, where a motivation for making the anchor was to counter loose hitting aces from the bar, *not* hitting will *also* leave Black good aces (hitting on the 11-point). Both hitting and not hitting will leave Black with good 6s from the bar.

It's bit surprising that making the 5-point is *not* best, when the 4-point was so close before. \n\nThe reason have to do with the need for unstacking the heavy midpoint. 5 checkers on a point is a big liability (I think the optimal number of checkers on any point is 3).\n\nThe point about unstacking is made clear in the next position, variation E:\n\n#### Variation E\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right layout-ncol=\"2\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](hit-or-point_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n1. 13/12* 6/3       eq:-0,072\nPlayer:   48,37% (G:10,66% B:0,42%)\nOpponent: 51,63% (G:13,49% B:0,54%)\n\n2. 8/5 6/5          eq:-0,080 (-0,008)\nPlayer:   47,75% (G:10,86% B:0,41%)\nOpponent: 52,25% (G:12,35% B:0,53%)\n\n3. 24/21 13/12*     eq:-0,101 (-0,030)\nPlayer:   47,74% (G:9,00% B:0,28%)\nOpponent: 52,26% (G:10,85% B:0,38%)\n\n4. 13/12* 12/9      eq:-0,105 (-0,033)\nPlayer:   47,46% (G:10,25% B:0,37%)\nOpponent: 52,54% (G:12,58% B:0,46%)\n\n5. 13/10 13/12*     eq:-0,111 (-0,040)\nPlayer:   47,47% (G:10,25% B:0,40%)\nOpponent: 52,53% (G:13,36% B:0,55%)\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow the big stack is on the 6-point, and the two best plays unstack just that point.
