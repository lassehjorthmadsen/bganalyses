It's the average error per decision (i.e. non-forced and non-trivial play). But for an individual player PR varies a lot from match to match, from tournament to tournament, or, presumably, over time. This is expected, since players face very different sets of decisions in each match. A match is, in essence, a random sample of all possible decision one will have to make in backgammon.\n\nIt would be nice to calculate confidence intervals and compute p-values, to give an idea of how accurate a given PR-result is.\n\nFor example:\n\n- Suppose I estimate my own playing strength at around, say, 4.0 PR. Now suppose I play a 17-point match at 6.0 PR. What is the most reasonable interpretation: a) That I for some reason played worse than usual, or b) That this is just an example of the natural variation given the relative small sample size?\n\n- Or, suppose that I play 8 matches in some tournament, for a combined PR of 4.5. Then, a year a later, I play 5.5 in another tournament. Is this evidence that my play has gotten worse, or is it likely to be just statistical noise?\n\nThe last case was a real life experience for me at the qualification tournaments for the Danish national team in 2024 and 2025. It would be nice to more confidently interpret these data.\n\n\n\n## To-do\n\n- Update bgmoves dataset\n- Use bgmoves dataset to estimate variance\n- Split the variance between me/opponents, and checker play, cube decisions.\n- Calculate average number of moves for various match lengths\n- Calculate example of confidence intervals.\n- Test hypotheses:\n    - PR_2025 < PR_2024\n    - PR_live < PR_online\n- Examine data from VM kval. 2024 and 2025\n  - Distribution of PRs\n  - Do players PR vary by about the expected amount?",
