I expected the take point to be a bit higher than for money, but apparently that is not the case.\n\nMy thinking was, that points get progressively more valuable the closer you get to the end of a match: At double match point you have 50% chance of winning, an actual win get you to 100%, so a point is worth 50 percentage points. At 17-away, 17-away a single point win get you from 50% to 54% so is worth just 4 percentage points. At 5-away, 5-away a point is worth about 8 percentage points.\n\nSo in a sense doubling more than doubles the stakes. A bit like 'doubling' from 4 to not 8 but perhaps 9 points. That should make you *more* reluctant to take, I thought. \n\nAn actual calculation shows that the take point when doubled from 4 to 8 at 13-away, 13-away is\n24.8% -- practically the same as for money, if anything a bit *lower*.\n\nThat agrees with the numbers in the position above; White can take with just 23.9%, since he gains a bit from being able to double Black out efficiently when they get to a two-roll position. \n\nSo exactly where did my logic go wrong?\n\nThe thing is, as the cube get bigger, the value of the points *currently* at stake also increases, so doubling does not necessarily \"more that doubles\" the stakes as I thought. Here's a table to illustrate:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Match length </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Value of a 4 point win </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Value of a 8 point win </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Ratio </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 9 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 22.5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 44.4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.97 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 21.3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 42.3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.99 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 11 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 20.0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 39.4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.97 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 12 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19.1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 37.9 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.98 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 18.2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 36.0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.98 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 14 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17.5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 34.7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.98 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16.8 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 33.3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.98 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 16.2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 32.2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.99 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 17 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15.6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 31.0 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.99 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 18 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 15.1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 30.1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.99 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 19 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 14.7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 29.2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.99 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 20 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 14.2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 28.4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.99 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 21 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 13.9 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 27.6 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.99 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe see that the value of both a 4-point win and an 8-point win increases as the match gets shorter, but the *ratio* between the two remains approximately the same, just about 2. So doubling from 4 to 8 does in fact double the stakes, not more than that.\n\nLet's plot the take points for more scores and more cube values:\n\n\n::: {.cell .column-page-right}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](big-cubes_files/figure-html/plot-1.png){width=576}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNear the end of the match the take points can be a bit funny, as we know. When both players need 4 points, it's hard to take a 4-cube (take point 33%). Here, doubling from 2 to 4 does indeed \"more that doubles\" the stakes. \n\nAt the other extreme, at 5-away, 5-away, it's easy to take an 8-cube, because the alternative, dropping, would leave you with just 15.8% winning chances.\n\nAt longer matches, when the score is tied, cubes at the 1-, 2- or 4-levels behaves just like for money, as we might expect.\n\n8- and 16-cubes are different, however. These take-point are quite a bit lower that 25% (unless the match is *very* long). There intuition here is that conceding 8 or 16 points would leave you in a pretty desperate situaition anyway, so it's not something one should do easily. \n\n",
