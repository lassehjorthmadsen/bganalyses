They are collected from my own matches, at the moment mostly online matches at [Backgammon Galaxy](play.backgammongalaxy.com).\n\nI picked ones that I though had learning potential, i.e. where I made some sort of conceptual mistake. So no mistakes from oversights, mis-clicks, or general sloppiness.\n\nFor the most part, the positions are presented as money games, even if they originally were from matches. This is in order to focus on the *concepts* that I got wrong, not the particular matchscore. The exceptions are when I made a mistake *because* of the match score.\n\nI will try to organize the positions into meaningful themes, and will try to include variations, to highlight certain ideas. \n\n## Checker plays\n\n### Overplays\n### Underplays\n\n## Cube descisions\n\n### Missed doubles\n### Wrong doubles\n\n## Match play mistakes",
