In particular, we apply the Janowski Formular(s) and try to figure out what it means when the eXtreme Gammon Documentation says that \"In eXtreme Gammon the Janowski formula has been extended to apply also in match play\".\n\n## How XG works\n\nThey basic mechanism is this:\n\n-   A neural net evaluates a position and come up with six probabilities for either winning or losing a regular game, a gammon and a backgammon. The estimated probabilities are for cubeless money game: What will happen if the game is played to conclusion with no doubling cube at money game conditions.\n\n-   To improve the quality of this estimate, a weighted average of all possible positions after one and after two rolls is calculated; what we call 2- and 3-ply evaluations. The initial neural net evaluation is 1-ply. (In GNU BG, the corresponding plies are called 0, 1, 2, etc.)\n\n-   From the estimated probability distribution, it is easy to calculate an expected, or average outcome, the *equity* of the position. This is still assuming money game with no doubling cube. Since that situation *never* happens under official rules, this number is not terribly relevant. Therefore, XG tries to estimate what the *cubeful* equity is, using [formulas](https://bkgm.com/articles/Janowski/cubeformulae.pdf) develped by Rick Janowski.\n\n## Janowski formulas\n\nWe won't explain in detail how all of Rick Janowski's formulas work (that is in the article linked above), we'll explain the idea and discuss examples.\n\nFirst, money game.\n\n## Money game\n\nAs mentioned , a game of backgammon played to conclusion can end in six possible ways. A certain position in Janowski's article, have the following probabilities of each outcome:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Regular </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Gammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Backgammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Sum </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Player wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.47 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.17 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.01 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.65 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Opponent wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.31 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.04 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.00 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.35 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Sum </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.78 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.21 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.01 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 1.00 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe average win is then:\n\n$$W=\\frac{47 \\times 1  + 17 \\times 2 + 1 \\times 3}{47 + 17 + 1} = 1.292\\ points$$\n\nThe average loss will be:\n\n$$L=\\frac{31 \\times 1  + 4 \\times 2 + 0 \\times 3}{31 + 4 + 0} = 1.114\\ points$$ \nThe values are all assuming a cube-level of 1, also called *normalized* values. To get the monetary value, they will have to be multiplied by the cube value and the stakes per point.\n\nThe take point, *not* taking re-cubes into account, aka the *dead-cube* take point, is:\n\n$$TP= \\frac{L-0.5}{W+L}$$\n\nThis is just another way to express the familiar take point formula, most often written like this:\n\n$$TP= \\frac{Risk}{Gain + Risk}$$\n\nSo, as an example, using the above figures for average wins and losses, our dead-cube take point would be:\n\n$$TP = \\frac{1.114 - 0.5}{1.292 + 1.114} = 0.255$$ \n\nThe dead-cube take point is what we might use in a last roll situation: When the opponent will either win or lose om the next roll, and we will never get the opportunity to redouble.\n\nThe opposite situation is what we might call the *live-cube* take point, where we unrealistically assume that our redoubles will always be fully efficient; we will redouble exactly at our opponent's take point, when he or she will be indifferent between taking and passing.\n\nThe *real* take point for most positions is somewhere between these two extremes: Lower that the pessimistic dead-cube take point, but higher that the overly optimistic live-cube take point.\n\n### The continous model\n\nTo calculate the live-cube take point, we need to briefly visit the so-called continuous model, proposed by Keeler and Spencer, as long back as 1975, in an article called [*Optimal Doubling in Backgammon*](https://bkgm.com/articles/KeelerSpencer/OptimalDoublingInBackgammon/index.html).\n\nThe basic idea is simple: Suppose the winning chance in some game moves smoothly and randomly along. $E$ is the event that the winning probability, $x,$ of player A, rises to $x+b$ before it drops to $x-a$. The probability of $E$ is then:\n\n$$P(E) = \\frac{a}{a+b}$$\n\nThis applies to any game where winning chance move continuously as time passes. Wheeler and Spencer has a nice example from basketball, paraphrased like this:\n\nSuppose UCLA has a 90% chance of beating MIT. What is the probability that MIT will have 50% chance of winning at some point during a game? In other words, the probability of MIT winning will have to rise from $0.1$ to $0.5$ before it drops from $0.1$ to $0.0$. So $a = 0.1, b = 0.4$. Then: \n\n$$P(E) = \\frac{0.1}{0.1+0.4} = 0.2$$\n\nThe probability that MIT will at some point have an even game is: $0.2 = 20\\%$.\n\nApplying this to backgammon, let's assume that we accept a cube with winning chances of $0.2$ and that we can double our opponent efficiently out if we reach a winning chance of $0.8$. What are our actual winning chances then, assuming a perfectly continuous game? We need to improve from $0.2$ to $0.8$ before we deteriorate from $0.2$ to $0.0$ so $a=0.2, b=0.6$, and:\n\n$$P(E) = \\frac{0.2}{0.2+0.6} = \\frac{1}{4} = 0.25$$\n\nIn other words: The optimistic live-cube model would allow us to take a gammonless game with a cubeless winning probability of just $0.2$ since cube access would turn that into the necessary $0.25$ winning probability. (Keeler and Spencer has a more formal proof of the $0.2$ live-cube take point.)\n\nAs mentioned, the real-life take point would have to be found somewhere between the live-cube take point of $0.2$ and the dead-cube take point of $0.25$. We can think of it as the weighted average of the two, where the weight represents the *cube efficiency* or what Janowski calls the *cube-life index*. \n\nExperiments show that in long races the take point is about $0.215$, suggesting a cube efficiency of $0.7$ since $0.7\\times 0.20 + 0.3\\times 0.25 = 0.215$ \n\nIncorporating this into the Janowski formular for take points, we can get an estimated, \"real\" take point, that takes recubes *and* cube efficiency into account:\n\n$$TP= \\frac{L-0.5}{W+L+0.5x}$$\n\nwhere $x$ is what Janowski calls the *cube-life index*, a number between 0 (where the cube is dead) and 1, where all doubles are efficient, i.e. right at the borderline between a take and a pass.\n\n### Equity from cube location\n\nExpanding the above ideas, the Janowski-formulas can be rearranged to express the *equity*, as a function of game winning chances, $p$, cube efficiency, $x$, and cube location (*player*, *center*, *opponent*):\n\n$$E_{player}= p(W+L+0.5x)-L$$ $$E_{center}= p(W+L+0.5x)-L-0.5x$$ $$E_{opponent}= \\frac{4}{4-x}(p(W+L+0.5x)-L-0.25x)$$\n\nFrom these, we can estimate cube actions and the size of any cube errors.\n\nA couple of observations:\n\n-   It shouldn't be too difficult to extend this to match play, since $W$ and $L$ can be calculated with match equities, rather than 1, 2, 3 for regular, gammon and backgammon.\n\n-   It is a simplification to assume that gammon frequencies and cube efficiency remain constant through a game; near conclusion games are more likely to be races without gammons and with fewer opportunities to double efficiently.\n\nLet's do a few practical examples and check if the formulas agree with what XG says.\n\n### Examples\n\n#### Opening position\n\nLet's look at a position after Black opens with 21, slotting:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](janowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAccording to XG 1-ply, the probabilities of the six possible outcomes of the game, if played to conclusion, are as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Regular </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Gammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Backgammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Sum </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Player wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.3571 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.1316 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0102 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.4989 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Opponent wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.3654 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.1285 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0072 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.5011 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Sum </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.7225 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.2601 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0174 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 1.0000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis comes to a cubeless equity of: $E = 0.0069$; White is a slight underdog to win, but is compensated by a tiny bit of extra gammons and backgammons, so that the game is basically even.\n\nNote that the numbers that XG reports are probabilities for winning (*including* gammons and backgammons), gammon (*including* backgammon), and backgammon. They have to be converted to get probabilities that sum to 1, like in the above table, if one prefers that way of looking at it. (My R-package, [`backgammon`](https://lassehjorthmadsen.github.io/backgammon/index.html) has a function for that.)\n\nIf we apply Janowski's take point formulars to the above cubeless probablities, we get:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cube </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Black's take point </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> White's take point </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Dead </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.3107 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.3032 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Perfectly live </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.2604 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.2541 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAll these four numbers align perfectly with what you get when you consult XGs `Analyze|Cube Information` menu. GNU Backgammon, in `Analyze|Market Window`, also gives the exact same take points. We can conclude that both programs probably implemented Janowski's take point formular in the same way for money games.\n\nOf course, the interesting bit is the *actual* take points; the \"Dead\" and \"Perfectly live\" take point are just lower and upper bounds between which the \"real\" take point must be found. As mentioned, Janowski just takes a weighted average of the two, to arrive at a guesstimate for the real take point.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nPutting aside for a moment the take points, let's look at the cubeful *equities*, i.e. the average or *expected* value of a position, while taking into account the doubling cube. For White in the above position, using the Janowski formulas, and assuming a cube-life index of $0.7$, we get:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cube location </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Calculated Equity </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> XG BG reported Equity </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Owned by Player </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.182 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Centered </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.008 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Owned by Opponent </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -0.337 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe calculated equities agrees pretty closely with what XG says. \n\nNote that XGs reported equity listed as \"Owned by Opponent\" is doubled, so you can directly compare a non-double action to a double/take action. This is why it looks like Opponent (Black), has about double the equity as Player (White), if owning the cube.\n\nLet's examine what GNU says about the same position, to find out if it is applying Janowski like I expect it to. You can't input specific probabilities, and get the estimated cubeful equities for each cube location, so we'll need to switch to GNU's evaluations, which of course are slightly different from XG's.\n\nHere, GNU 2-ply (what XG calls 3-ply) cubeless estimates for the same opening position:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Regular </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Gammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Backgammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Sum </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Player wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.3547 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.1346 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0097 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.499 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Opponent wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.3582 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.1353 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0075 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.501 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Sum </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.7129 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.2699 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0172 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 1.000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich comes to a cubeless *equity* of $E = 0.0017$. \n\nThe [GNU Backgammon Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnubg/manual/gnubg.html), helpfully states that they use a cube-life index, or cube efficiency, of $0.68$ for contact positions. Applying Janowski's formulars for cubeful equity to the above probabilities and, using $0.68$ as cube efficiency, we get:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Cube location </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Calculated Equity </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> GNU BG reported Equity </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Owned by Player </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.1714 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.1722 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Centered </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0016 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0036 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Owned by Opponent </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -0.3373 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> -0.3373 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThose are all near-identical to what GNU reports. I'm a little unsure if the small discrepancies are due to rounding errors or some other details that I'm not aware of.\n\nGoing back to the questions of which cube-life index XG uses: Perhaps it depends on the position? (GNU BG uses a slightly lower value, $0.60$ rather than $0.68$, in short races.)\n\nLets do another example to try to find out.\n\n#### Bear-off position\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](janowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-10-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Regular </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Gammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Backgammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Sum </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Player wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm;

The reason for the discrepancy (especially with the cube in the middle) is not obvious. (I used 1-ply to make sure the difference is not due to how the numbers gets aggregated at higher plies.)\n\n## Match play\n\nIn match play, we're not interested in how much we win or lose in a single game, but in the probability of winning the whole match. For this reason, the appropriate unit is no longer the average value or equity of a position, but our match winning chances, $mwc$.\n\n### The live cube take point\n\nLet's see if we can generalize the Janowski formulas to match play. The loss, L, and win, W, part from the money game section above, should be easy enough: We can just plug in match equities from from Kazaross XG2 match equity table, to get the average $mwc$ when losing or winning respectively.\n\nFrom the continuous model described above, we know that for money:\n\n$$TP_{live} = TP_{dead}\\times(1-TP_{live})$$\n\nBecause as we now know, $TP_{dead}= 0.25$ and $TP_{live} = 0.20$, so that: \n\n$$TP_{live} = 0.25\\times(1-0.20) = 0.20$$\n\nThe intuition behind this is, that when we hold he cube, we are \"in the game until the end,\" that is, until our winning chances are zero, but we don't have to go to 100% to win; when we have winning chances of $0.8$, we can use the cube to effectively win the game.\n\nIn match play, our opponent may have a take point different from ours, so we would need to think:\n\n$$TP_{live} = TP_{dead}\\times(1-TP_{opponent})$$\n\nwhere $TP_{live}$ is *our* live cube take point, and $TP_{opponent}$ is the opponent's live cube take point, i.e. assuming all doubles are perfectly efficient. (Again, this is not a very realistic assumption; we use it just to come up with the *lowest* take point that we can possibly have.)\n\n### Example: 5-away, 3-away\n\nLet's do the simplest possible example of a live cube take point. We're trailing 5-away, 3-away, (-5,-3 for short), it's a long race, and we're being offered an initial double. What are our most optimistic and least optimistic take points?\n\nOur take point assuming a dead cube is $0.287$ (we skip the actual calculation; it is just the standard one, that I mentioned earlier, $TP= \\frac{Risk}{Gain + Risk}$).\n\nIf we ever *redouble*, then our opponent, if accepting, will have a dead cube, so their live and dead take point is the same, $0.334$. This is quite high, due to the fact that we can use all four points; our opponent can use only three. That is good news for us, since we don't have to improve nearly as much as in money game to win with the cube. So in this case, applying the continious model, we get: \n\n$$TP_{live}=0.287\\times (1- 0.334) = 0.191$$\n\nSo there's a big difference between the dead-cube and the live-cube take points which make a lot of sense, because owning a cube at 2 when trailing (-5,-3) really is powerful: We only risk one additional point when redoubling, but we can win *two* extra points. *And* the opponent will be holding a dead cube, so we're not giving away anything.\n\nFor overview, we can put our results in a table like this, adding a column for the \"real\" take point, which, as mentioned, is just a weighted average of the dead- and the live-cube take point. (Using a weight, or cube efficiency, of $0.7$.)\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Taker, points away </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Doubler, points away </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Cube value </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Dead-cube take point </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Live-cube take point </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Real-cube take point </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.33401 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.33401 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.33401 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 5 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 3 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.28731 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.19135 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.22014 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese are all the same numbers that GNU BG and XG reports, in the \"Market window\" and \"Cube Information\" dialog boxes. And rollouts suggest that in a long race (I tried 125 pips vs 139 pips) you have a small take with about 22% winning chances, like the \"real-cube\" average indicate.\n\nThis is about the same as in money game, so the lesson for this score (-5, -3) is that the extraordinary cube leverage just about cancels out the somewhat higher take point (of $0.287$) one would have without using the cube, so in the end the take point is close to money game. Of course this is for a long race; if it was a very short race or even a last-roll situation we would be back to the higher take point. A four-roll position would be a pass, for example.\n\n### Example: 25-away, 24-away\n\nFor fun, let's study the same example for a much longer match; now we're being initially doubled when trailing 25-away, 24-away, (-25, -24). Since the recube vig propagates all the way through redouble after redouble, we have to start by considering the last possible double. Counting at fingers, we can discover that the last possible double (after multiple turn-arounds and cube actions), would be when the opponent owns a 16-cube, and we need to decide if we should pass and trail (-25, -8) or accept a 32-cube which will be dead hereafter.\n\nAll the take points, in tabular form, starting with the 16-cube, where the live-cube take point is identical to the dead-cube take point:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Taker, points away </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Doubler, points away </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Cube value </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Dead-cube take point </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Live-cube take point </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Real-cube take point </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 24 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 16 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.043 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.043 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.043 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 24 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 8 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.233 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.223 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.226 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 24 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.243 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.189 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.205 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 24 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.254 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.206 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.221 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 25 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 24 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.253 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.201 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.216 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFrom the table we can note that our \"real-cube\" take point for the initial double is $0.216$, again about the same as for money, which is not surprising in a straight race at the beginning of a long match. We note also our take point, should we ever face a 32-cube, is very low: $0.043$. That's what we have if we trail (-25, -8), so if we're doing any better, we should take. \n\nThat means also that the 16-cube is of little value to the opponent, since to use it efficiently, he or she must nearly win first. One way to see that, is to notice that their take point for the 16-cube, is almost the same in the dead-cube model as in the live-cube model. ($0.233$ and $0.223$ respectively.)\n\nIn a funny way, *all* the take points affects our take point for the initial double, since the calculations are recursive, with each take point affecting the next.\n\nTo see this more clearly, we can write out the full calculations. For simplicity, we use $TP_1, TP_2, TP_4, TP_8$, and $TP_{16}$ to indicate the dead-cube take points when the cube is at 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. (The column \"Dead-cube take point\" from the table.) $TP_{1_{live}}$ is the live-cube take point when the cube is at $1.$\n\nThen:\n\n$$TP_{1_{live}} = TP_1 \\times (1 - TP_2 \\times (1 - TP_4 \\times (1- TP_8 \\times (1-TP_{16}))))$$\nWhich can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nTP_{1_{live}} = TP_1 \\\\ \n- TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\\\ \n+ TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\times TP_4 \\\\ \n- TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\times TP_4 \\times TP_8 \\\\ \n+ TP_1 \\times TP_2 \\times TP_4 \\times TP_8 \\times TP_{16} \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\nSo it is clear that the big effect on the live-cube take point of course is from the actual dead-cube take point, at the same cube level. Our take point if we eventually gets redoubled from 16 to 32, $TP_{16}$, plays very little role, and is only of theoretical interest. Our opponent's take point when we redouble, $TP_2$, on the other hand, does play a role, as the (-5,-3) example showed. \n\nWe can plot the take points to show this effect, starting with the dead-cube take point at cube level 1, then work subsequent take points into the live cube model, one by one: \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](janowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nWe see how we get from the initial dead-cube take point of 0.253 to the live-cube take point of 0.201. Each subsequent take point has less and less of an impact on our initial take point. And let's just rember once again that the real take point is to be found between these two values; when the game still has a way to go, it is usually closer to live-cube take point that to the dead-cube take point.\n\n### Example with gammons\n\nOkay, so far it seems possible to (more or less) reproduce how XG and GNU BG transforms cubeless distributions into cubeful match equities and takepoints. Let's try a match play example with lots of gammons, with us playing White and leading (-4,-7).\n\nA standard opening blitz after 63, 55, dance, looks like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](janowski_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-21-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n GNU BG 2-ply evaluates the position like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\">   </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Regular </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Gammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Backgammon </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Sum </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Player wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.2877 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.3626 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0078 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.6581 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Opponent wins </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.2612 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0769 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0038 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.3419 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Sum </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.5489 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.4395 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 0.0116 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 3.1cm; \"> 1.0000 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe're clear favorites with a strong gammon threat; it is more likely that we will win a gammon than a single game. If we double, a gammon will win the match exactly, while a single win will put us at 2-away which is also valuable. However, our opponent will be quick to redouble, after which our gammons will be worthless and his gammons will be leathal. \n\nSo, what's the buttom line? Do we have a double? Can our opponent take? \n\nApplying the Janowski formulas, we get take points for Black, and take points for White for the potential recube, as follows:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table>\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Taker, points away </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Doubler, points away </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Cube value </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Dead-cube take point </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Live-cube take point </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Real-cube take point </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 2 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.3716 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.3716 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.3716 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 7 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 4 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 1 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.4315 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.2711 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;width: 5cm; \"> 0.3225 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the last row we see that Black as a very high take point, 0.4315, for the reason mentioned: The likely gammon will lose the match. Should Black turn the match around, however, White *also* has a high takepoint, 0.3716, and since the cube would be dead, there's no further benefit; the live-cube takepoint is the same as the dead-cube takepoint. For that reason, Black's live-cube and real-cube takepoints are much lower: The model suggests Black would be able to take with a winning probability of 0.3225. \n\n\n## Conclusions",
